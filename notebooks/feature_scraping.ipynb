First, it should allow for both superfluid and Mott insulating ground states (the Bogoliubov theory fails in this instance). Second, a variety of methods concur on the nature of the collective excitation spectrum in the two phases. In the superfluid phase, there is a gapless sound mode that 7 arises from phase fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter. Near the fixed density quantum critical point (QCP) there is also a gapped (Higgs) mode corresponding to amplitude fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter that has been predicted in a variety of calculations [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] and observed experimentally for bosons in two-and-three dimensional optical lattices [123, 124] .  \n",
