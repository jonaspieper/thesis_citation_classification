      "      \"abstract\": \"Decision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler, faster strategies to find a 'good enough' option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behaviours including foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study of a collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decision strategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possible decision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simple rule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can account parsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when available nests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. We present empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individual sequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able to effectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. This parsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making\",\n",

The fitness benefits of choosing the best option mean thatdecision-making strategies will be subject to natural selection. Mul-tiple comparison or \\u2018best of n\\u2019 strategies perform most accurately,and are likely to be optimal when searching and sampling costs arelow, e.g. on a lek [1,2] and when long-term fitness implications ofthe decision are high, e.g. in home range selection [3]. In othersituations, e.g. during foraging, there can be substantial time coststo making accurate decisions [4,5], and these costs can be so greatas to make quicker less accurate decisions more efficient [6]. Ani-mals may be best served by using a simpler \\u2018rule of thumb\\u2019, whichreduces sampling time, but still ensures the option they choose isgood enough. One simple but effective strategy is sequential searchin which the animal keeps searching until it finds an option thatexceeds a threshold of acceptability [2,7]. This kind of fixed-threshold strategy is used in foraging [8], mate choice [9] andrefuge selection [10]. An intermediate strategy is to allow thresh-olds to be influenced by experience of previous options; in effectthis would cause a \\u2018sequential comparison\\u2019.Social animals make collective decisions between availableoptions, particularly about where the group spends its time. Whenmaking a shared collective decision, a group faces the challenges ofintegrating information from multiple individuals and managingthe different decision-preferences of group members [11]. Suchdecisions are influenced by individual information, conflicts ofinterest and time-constraints [12,13]. To understand how a col-lective decision is reached, the rules followed by contributingmembers of the group must be identified [14]. Emigrating socialinsects are a good model system for the study of collective decision-making, because all members share the aim of coming to a con-sensus about a new, good nest site as soon as possible, but theinformation about available site quality is distributed very un-evenly within the colony [15,16]. To investigate the mechanismof decision making, we used models of, and experiments on,emigrating cavity-nesting rock ants, Temnothorax albipennis.A colony emigration by rock ants begins with scouts searchingfor and assessing new sites. Successful scouts recruit nest-matesusing tandem running, in which an informed ant leads another tothe new site [17]. When the number of ants at a site reaches a\\u2018quorum threshold\\u2019, the ants switch to rapid transport behaviour tocarry the brood, queen and remaining nest-mates to the new nest[18]. Ant colonies discriminate between nest sites on the basis of arange of attributes including cavity dimensions, light level andentrance width [16,19]. Three possible mechanisms by which thecolony collectively chooses the better of two nests have beenproposed: i) comparison ii) recruitment latency iii) threshold rule.PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981First, ants could use a comparison strategy, in which ants that havevisited both nests would compare their qualities and recruit nest-mates only to the better one [20]. Second, ants visiting just onenest could determine how long they hesitate before recruiting nest-mates (recruitment latency) based on the nest quality [20]. Acombination of these two mechanisms has been used as the basis ofseveral decision models [18,21\\u201324]. Although lone T. rugatulus antworkers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites whichare very close together [25], the evidence for individual antsmaking direct comparisons between nests during colony emigra-tion is weak [26], and furthermore, ant colonies are able to choosea distant good nest over a nearby poor nest, when recruitmentlatency differences would be expected to be cancelled out by traveltime (Fig. 1a) [26,27]. The third possible mechanism of choice is asequential search strategy, based on a very simple rule of thumb, a\\u2018threshold rule\\u2019, by which an ant assesses a nest against her ownfixed quality threshold, and either accepts the nest and beginsrecruitment, or rejects it and continues searching [26]. Quality-dependent recruitment latency has been demonstrated empiricallyonly when colonies were presented with a single new nest and werenot required to make a choice [20,22,24,28]. Robinson et al. [26]hypothesized that these apparent recruitment latency effects couldemerge as a by-product of a threshold rule, because ants that finda low-quality nest will tend to reject it and continue searching,whereas ants that find a high quality nest will tend to accept it andbegin recruitment. In addition, Robinson et al. [26] hypothesizedthat the apparent comparison phenomenon in which ants thathave visited equidistant poor and good nests usually recruit only tothe good nest (Fig. 1b; [20]) can be explained more parsimoniouslywith a threshold rule in which the poor nest is rejected and for-gotten, then the good nest is discovered and accepted, rather thanrequiring individual ants to perform the more cognitively complextask of remembering and comparing the qualities of different nests.We aim to test the hypothesis that this simple parsimoniousmechanism (the threshold rule) is sufficient to reproduce observedempirical patterns of collective decision-making.Here we present a Markov-chain model of decision-making,based on a simple threshold rule. Our model ants search for nests,and compare those they find to an internal acceptance threshold,subject to assessment error. This model includes no memory ofprevious nests, and no ability to make direct comparisons betweenthe nests an ant has encountered. It also includes no explicitquality-dependent recruitment latency. We compare the results ofthis model to empirical results from two published studies and onenew experiment, to test whether our model can produce thequalitative patterns seen in the empirical data. By parameterizingour model as far as possible to previous experiments [20,26] wetest whether this simple threshold-rule is sufficient to explainapparent recruitment latency and comparison effects. We also usethe model to predict emigration behaviour in a new experimentthat presents an ant colony with three equidistant nests, one goodand two poor (Fig. 1c). We performed this experiment usingindividually radio-tagged ants to monitor individual-level behav-iour and compare our empirical results to the model predictions.We thus test whether a very simple individual-level \\u2018rule of thumb\\u2019is sufficient to explain sophisticated collective decision-making.MethodsModelTo investigate the proposed threshold rule, we present a verysimple model. As we are only concerned with independent dis-covery by scouts before recruitment commences, we examine thecolony\\u2019s decision process analytically and using Monte-Carlo sim-ulation, modelling ants as independent instantiations of a Markovprocess. Ants independently accept sites according to a probabilityspecified by the site\\u2019s quality and their individual threshold, other-wise they search randomly for a site to assess (Fig. 2). We havemodelled a discontinuous acceptance function here, but this couldbe relaxed to be a smooth (e.g. sigmoidal) function of differencebetween internal threshold and sampled quality, without qualita-tively affecting the results. The Markov process has five states:\\u2018assessing home site\\u2019, \\u2018assessing poor site\\u2019, \\u2018assessing good site\\u2019,\\u2018committed to poor site\\u2019, and \\u2018committed to good site\\u2019. Allindividuals start in the \\u2018assessing home site\\u2019 state but the home siteis considered uninhabitable in the model, and its quality is set toFigure 1.

A simulated ant continues searchinguntil it encounters a nest of a quality (b) exceeding the ant\\u2019s individualthreshold (a), taking into account assessment error (e). Ants may revisitthe same nest (with probability r), and do not have any memory ofpreviously visited nests.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019981.g002A Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981negative infinity, therefore an ant can never become committed toit. Ants can switch between the assessment states, but we assumethat once committed to a site an ant remains so and recruits nest-mates to its preferred option; the recruitment process is not mod-elled, and the \\u2018committed\\u2019 states are therefore absorbing states.For the Monte-Carlo simulations, we model nest quality accep-tance thresholds in the colony as a normally distributed randomvariable A, with some mean and variance. An individual simulatedant has a quality acceptance threshold a drawn at random fromthis distribution. It discovers its next nest by sampling from aprobability distribution specified by its current nest, arena size andshape, and the proximities of other available nest sites (Table 1);part of this distribution is determined by the probability r that arandomly searching scout rediscovers the site it has just been in.On discovering a site, the scout evaluates the quality of the currentnest site with some error e added, sampled from a standard normaldistribution (mean 0; standard deviation 1); this corresponds toerror in the scout\\u2019s quality assessment. If this sampled qualityexceeds the scout\\u2019s acceptance threshold then it becomes com-mitted to the site, otherwise it continues searching (Fig. 2). Accep-tance threshold distributions and nest qualities are given arbitraryvalues (Table 1), because individual probabilities of becomingcommitted to a nest are hard to estimate empirically, due to thedifficulties in accurately identifying commitment and in eliminat-ing the effects of interactions between ants. In the model, traveltimes between sites are sampled from normal distributions. Byparameterizing this model to empirical ant movement speed andspecific experimental arenas (Table 1), we can approximate theexpected time for each simulated ant to find each nest, and thetime from first finding a nest to becoming committed to it (the antmay visit other nests in between, or visit the same nest many timesbefore committing to it). This allows us to calculate recruitmentlatencies for comparison with empirical data. In the empiricalstudies, recruitment latency concerns the time from discovering anest to first recruiting to that nest. We do not include recruitmentin the model, so modelled recruitment latency concerns the timefrom discovering a nest to \\u2018accepting\\u2019 that nest. For real antcolonies, searching behaviour is much reduced when quorum isachieved; we truncate the simulated data at the time at whichquorum was achieved in the real experiment, to increase com-parability (see Text S1).Model Analysis. In addition to the simulation model de-scribed in this paper, we can derive analytic results for the pro-posed rule for switching between nests. To facilitate this analysiswe simplify the Markov process slightly from that used in theMonte-Carlo simulations, by discarding the state of assessing thehome site. The four states in the simplified Markov process arethus \\u2018assessing poor site\\u2019, \\u2018assessing good site\\u2019, \\u2018committed to poorsite\\u2019, and \\u2018committed to good site\\u2019, and the state transition matrixis (with states ordered as described above from top to bottom andfrom left to right)Q~(1{p)r (1{g)(1{r) 0 0(1{p)(1{r) (1{g)r 0 0p 0 1 00 g 0 10BBB@1CCCA, \\u00f01\\u00dewhere p is the average per-visit probability that an ant accepts thepoor site, g is the average per-visit probability that an ant acceptsthe good site, and r is the probability that a randomly searchingscout rediscovers the site it has just been in. These are colony-wideaverage probabilities that can easily be derived from the thresholdA and error N(0,1) distributions used in the Monte-Carlosimulation, if comparability is desired. The matrix Q in eq. 1can be understood as having a column corresponding to each stateTable 1.

The probability distribution over theinitial states (\\u2018assessing poor site\\u2019 and \\u2018assessing good site\\u2019) can bederived based on the relative probabilities of an arbitrary ant scoutdiscovering either when searching from the home site.Using standard techniques [e.g. 29] we derive analytic results onthe long-run behaviour of the threshold-switching rule, using thestate transition matrix Q (eq. 1) and its fundamental matrix. Ofparticular relevance to our proposals is the analysis of the expectedtime for the Markov-process to reach any absorbing state, whenstarted in some particular non-absorbing state. If we assume bothcandidate nest sites are equally likely to be discovered first from thehome site, then the expected number of steps in the Markov-chainbefore commitment to either nest site is reached is given byE(time to accept any site)~4(1{r)z2r(pzg){p{g2((2r{1)pgz(1{r)(pzg)): \\u00f02\\u00deEquation (2) will be used below to examine the sensitivity ofacceptance time to changes in site qualities. Note that, technically,we should be interested in the latency between discovering aparticular site, and recruiting to that site, however in general per-state latencies are difficult to calculate in Markov-chains, and theoverall expected latency given in equation 2 is an acceptable sim-plification (see Text S1).Empirical methodsEthics statement. Our experiments on T. albipennis andcollection of colonies from the field comply with the laws of thecountry in which they were carried out and the relevant nationaland international guidelines [30,31].\\u2018Three-New-Nests\\u2019 Experiment. Six T. albipennis colonieswere collected from the Dorset coast, England, June\\u2013July 2009.Colonies were queenright and contained 80\\u2013200 workers andbrood of all stages. Colonies were housed in artificial nests [27]and provided with water ad libitum and honey solution andDrosophila melanogaster weekly. We used these colonies to investigatedecision-making when a colony was offered a choice of three newnests. Six trials were performed, each with a new colony. One dayprior to an emigration trial, we attached an RFID micro-transponder (50065006120 mm) with a unique ID to the thoraxof every worker ant in the colony [32,33] and housed the colony ina nest formed of a hexagonal glass slide (edge length = 30 mm), a1.5 mm cardboard perimeter (cavity area 1496 mm2) and anacetate lid with a central entrance hole (1.5 mm diameter) to avoidintroducing directional bias. We performed trials in a circulararena with Fluon-coated sides, the floor of which was cleaned withwater and alcohol between trials. Three new hexagonal nests withthe same dimensions as the original nest were placed in the arena(Fig. 1c). Two nests had clear acetate lids and one had a red filtercovering the cavity area, making the nest appear relatively dark tothe ants [34]. Ant colonies choose dark over light nests [19]. Theposition of the good nest was interchanged between trials. Thenew nests had 1.5 mm wide entrances in the side facing the centreof the arena, over which RFID readers (PharmaSeq, Inc., NJ) wereplaced vertically. A trial began with the original nest placed in thecentre of the arena and then destroyed by removing the lid. TheRFID readers detected ants entering and leaving the new nests[86% tag read rate, 26] and we used handheld RFID readers toread the tags on tandem-running ants (94% tag read rate) as theycrossed half-way lines (Fig. 1c). The identity of the leader andfollower was thus recorded and the direction of the tandem runwas noted. This procedure does not disrupt tandem runs [26]. Thetime at which the transport by carrying of a nest-mate or a brooditem first occurred to each nest was recorded (i.e. the time at whichthe quorum threshold was reached). Once nest-mate transport hascommenced, the RFID system becomes less reliable [26], becausenest-mates are transported in such a way as to block the RFID tag.We therefore focused our analysis on searching and recruitment bytandem-running during the pre-quorum period. We observedemigrations until complete (old nest empty of brood and workers)and recorded the nest choice of the colony after 24 hours. Colo-nies were considered to have split if brood was present in two ormore nests.Statistical MethodsMean recruitment latencies were analysed using generalisedlinear mixed models (GLMM) \\u2018glmmPQL\\u2019 in the MASS library inR 2.4.1 with nest quality as a fixed factor, colony (empirical results)or replicate (simulation results) as a random factor and a Poissonerror structure. Differences between recruitment latency survivor-ship curves, were tested using generalized log-rank tests using thefunction \\u2018survdiff\\u2019 in the survival library in R 2.4.1. Monte Carlosimulations were carried out using MatLab 7.4.0 (see Text S1),and matrix manipulation with Maple 14.ResultsComparison with Poor Nest Near; Good Nest Far DataWe parameterized the model to the experimental set-up used byRobinson et al. [26] with a nearby poor nest and a more distantgood nest (Table 1, Fig. 1a) and performed Monte Carlo simu-lations of this experiment. The switching behaviour (ants movingfrom visiting one nest to visiting the other) in the simulations isqualitatively very similar to the empirical data (Fig. 3). In bothcases most ants that find the far (good) nest first stay at that nest,whereas ants that find the near (poor) nest first may stay or switch.The model simulations also reproduce the empirical results thatrecruitment latency does not play an important role here. In theempirical study, recruitment latency was measured as time fromdiscovering a nest to first leading a tandem run to that nest anddata are only available for ants which recruited by tandem-running. There are more recruitment latencies for the simulateddata, as all ants make a choice in the model, whereas in the realdata not all active ants perform tandem runs. This leads toquantitative differences between simulated and empirical data, butqualitatively the patterns are the same: In the simulated data, as inthe empirical data, there are no significant differences betweenrecruitment latencies to the good and poor nests (Fig. 4a, 4b).However, in a simulation presenting the two nests separately (i.e.either only old nest and near poor nest are present, or only old nestand far good nest are present) the pattern is dramatically different,with significantly higher recruitment latencies for the poor nest(Fig. 4c). This clearly demonstrates that differences in recruitmentlatency can be generated when only one nest is present, as a side-effect of the threshold rule.Comparison with Two-Equidistant-Nests DataTo test whether our model can account for the patterns seen inthe original experiments, used as evidence for the recruitmentlatency and comparison mechanisms [20], we also parameterisedthe Monte Carlo model to this experimental set-up (Fig. 1b,Table 1). Here two equidistant new nests, one good and one poor,are presented to the ant colony. The empirical data for directcomparison are shown in Table 2. Very similar results emerge inour simulations, without any memory or comparison coded intothe model (Table 2), clearly showing that this sort of behaviouralpattern can be accounted for by the threshold rule alone, withoutA Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981needing to include other mechanisms. However, the exact quan-titative results of our simulations are influenced by the acceptancethreshold and nest quality parameters. Since we do not know theshape of the real threshold distribution in an ant colony, the matchbetween simulated and empirical data here does not prove thatcomparison plays no role in ant decision-making, but does showthat results of this type do not necessarily have to be the producedby comparative evaluation.In the empirical data (Fig. 5a\\u2013f), there do appear to be quality-dependent differences in recruitment latency \\u2013 however, the nestswere presented separately in these experiments. Recruitmentlatency is measured using survival analysis, treating ants that find asite but never recruit to it as censored data. Applying the sameanalysis to our simulated results demonstrates that we can repli-cate these differences in recruitment latency when the nests arepresented separately (Fig. 5g\\u2013l) but the differences disappear whenthe simulations are repeated identically, but with the nestspresented together (Fig. 5m\\u2013r). This is same pattern as wasobserved in the comparison with the the \\u2018poor nest near; good nestfar\\u2019 data, even though recruitment latencies are measureddifferently in the two empirical studies. These simulation resultsdemonstrate that the observed empirical differences in recruitmentFigure 3. Comparison of empirical and simulated emigration behavior.

We consider the two site case first; todo this we shall hold one of the nest site qualities constant whilevarying the other nest site quality, and examine the effect on theexpected time to reach commitment to either site. Figure 6illustrates how expected decision time varies for the one and twosite cases, for a given revisiting value of r (0.7, estimated fromempirical data). We vary the quality of the poor site (A) whilekeeping the quality of the good site (B) constant, holding g constantwhile varying p in the interval [0, 1] (see eq. 2). For a moderatequality of the constant nest (P(accept B) = g=0.88, estimated fromempirical data) expected decision time varies little between theextremes of the other nest\\u2019s quality (P(accept A) = p=0 to 1), thuswhen two nest sites are present, strong quality dependent recruit-ment latency is not evident (Fig. 6, solid line). This contrastsmarkedly with the situation where there is only one potential nestsite; this is equivalent to setting p= g in equation 2. Now a muchmore pronounced relationship between the quality of this site, andthe expected time until commitment, is evident (Fig. 6, dashedline). These analytic results agree qualitatively with results fromthe Monte-Carlo simulation (Fig. 5). This is good evidence forthe threshold rule, but does not in itself rule out sequential com-parisons since a version of the model with sequential comparisonsgives almost indistinguishable results (see Text S1, Fig. S2). How-ever, the sequential comparison model makes greater cognitivedemands on individuals, who must remember the qualities ofvisited sites and evaluate this in making subsequent comparisons.Three-New-Nests: Simulation Predictions and EmpiricalDataA total of 752 ants (across 6 colonies) were individually radio-tagged and their scouting activity was monitored during emi-gration experiments in which each colony chose between onegood and two poor nests (Fig. 1c). According to the thresholdrule, ants which independently (i.e. not by following a tandemrun) visit the good nest (A) and one of the poor nests (designatedB) and then visited another nest before quorum was reached (atwhich point carrying behaviour begins), should be equally likelyto return to good nest A or discover the other, equidistant, poornest (designated C). In contrast, if ants are using best-of-n directcomparisons, ants which have visited good nest A and then nest Bshould be more likely to return to A than to discover C.In the empirical data, 20 individuals out of the 752 wemonitored fulfilled the necessary behavioural criteria of finding Aand then B before quorum was reached. This sample size is smallbecause this behaviour was fairly rare \\u2013 as would be predicted byour model, ants finding A tended to start recruiting, rather thandiscover B. Using this sample size of 20 ants for 100 simulationreplicates gives 95% confidence intervals of 7\\u201312 ants returning toA; 8\\u201313 ants discovering C. The empirical data fit well withinthese limits, with 11 ants returning to A and 9 discovering C. Thisdoes not differ significantly from random choice (binomial test,P=0.82). This supports the threshold hypothesis and shows noevidence that ants act on information from comparison of nests toallow them to preferentially return to a better nest.Although our data show that ants did not preferentially returnto the good nest, the comparison hypothesis could still be sup-ported if those that did return to it did so more directly becausethey had remembered its high quality. This is not the case: antsmade 0\\u201327 (median= 3) repeat visits to B before returning to A,compared to 0\\u20136 (median= 0) visits to B before discovering C(Mann-Whitney test: U=73, N=20, P=0.07). The trend is in theopposite direction to that predicted by the hypothesis that antsmake a comparison and act on it to return more directly to betternests. These data are consistent with threshold-based choice.A second test of whether individual ants are comparing nestsinvolves decisions to recruit nest-mates by leading a tandem-runto the new nest. If ants are using a \\u2018best-of-n\\u2019 comparison strategy,the sampling period before recruiting should be independent ofthe quality of the first nest they visit, whereas if ants use aninternal threshold rule, the number of nests they sample beforerecruiting should be strongly dependent on the quality of the firstnest they visit, with ants that find the high quality nest first beinglikely to initiate recruitment to this nest immediately. In theempirical data, 13 individual ants initiated recruitment by leadinga tandem run, of which 8 had discovered the good nest first, and 5had discovered a poor nest first. Using these sample sizes for 100simulation replicates predicts that ants finding the good nest firstshould not visit any other nest before recruiting (median totalnests visited: 95%CI 1-1) whereas ants finding the poor nest firstshould be more likely to visit other nests before recruiting (mediantotal nests visited 95%CI 1-2). The empirical data fit thesepredictions. Ants which found the good nest first visited a medianof only that 1 nest before recruiting, whereas those which foundthe poor nest visited a median of 2 different nests before leading atandem run (Mann-Whitney test, U=36, N=13, P,0.05). Thedata do not support the recruitment latency mechanism, as thereare no quality-dependent differences in time from nest discov-ery to recruitment by tandem-running (good nest: mean 6SD= 20619 min; poor nest: mean 6 SD=28624 min; t-test:t12 = 0.71, P=0.49).DiscussionOur results show that a very simple individual mechanism canproduce effective collective decision-making. The predictions ofour threshold decision-making model correspond well withempirical data from house-hunting ants. Our simulations of theTable 2.

This explanationof empirical data is supported by our analytical modelling results.Our results clearly support the hypothesis that this simple par-simonious mechanism (the threshold rule) is sufficient to reproduceobserved empirical patterns of collective decision-making: ourresults can account for both apparent direct comparison of nestquality and for apparent quality-dependent recruitment latency,which had been previously proposed as mechanisms of collectivechoice. Our parsimonious threshold model is sufficient to explainthe data without assuming more complex behavioural mecha-nisms. This highlights the need for carefully designed experimentsto determine whether or not individuals make comparisons, anddemonstrates that group-level comparison behaviour does notnecessarily imply individual-level comparison behaviour. In thecase of ants, evidence of the ability of lone individuals to makedirect comparisons of alternatives has only recently been published[25]; as our results show, previously published studies were notsufficient to demonstrate this. Further empirical investigation isrequired to establish what role, if any, direct comparison by in-dividual ants plays in the collective decision-process.We can subdivide comparison behaviour into two types thatcan aid decision-making: best-of-n comparisons and sequentialcomparisons. Best-of-n comparison mechanisms are characterisedby a sampling period, and preferential return to the best option[35]. We conducted a multiple-nest experiment to test directly ifreal ants show these behaviours. Neither is observed. In contrast,the results support the threshold model: if the first nest theyencountered was of a high quality, the ants started recruitmentimmediately without continuing to sample, and those ants whichhad the opportunity to compare nests did not act on this infor-mation by preferential or more direct return to better nests.Sequential comparisons occur when each time an animal en-counters a new option, it compares the new option to its memoryof previously encountered options and is more likely to accept thenew one if it compares favourably. This is similar to the thresholdmodel, but thresholds are influenced by experience. In one variantof this, individuals sample several options and then accept the nextoption they encounter which exceeds the quality of all previousoptions. This strategy can be shown to provide the optimalsolution to the \\u2018secretary problem\\u2019; a sequential search problem inwhich previously encountered options are subsequently unavail-able [36]. We modelled a sequential comparison mechanism (seeText S1) to compare with our threshold model. The results showthat this type of comparison model predicts similar recruitmentlatency results to our threshold model. We therefore cannot ruleout this sequential comparison mechanism, but note that it is a lessparsimonious solution. Our threshold model is sufficient to explainthe data without invoking memory and comparison during thedecision process.Our simulated ants have no memory of previously visited nests,and yet behaviour previously described as \\u2018comparison\\u2019 stillemerges in our simulations (Table 2). This clearly shows thatempirical data of this sort cannot be used as evidence that ananimal is really remembering and comparing. The decisionprocess we propose is \\u2018memoryless\\u2019 in the sense that individualants do not have to remember previously visited alternativesduring their search for an acceptable nest. Our model deals onlywith the decision process up to the point at which an ant accepts anest. After that point, real ants clearly do use memory of nestlocation in order to recruit nest-mates to that nest by tandem-running [20]. Recruitment is the most easily identifiable actionindicating commitment, but ants that have accepted a nest mayalso act on their commitment by making repeat visits to the nest[26,37]. By making repeat visits, ants are able to assess nest areamore accurately [37] and would also contribute to the accumu-lation of a quorum at their chosen nest, causing the switch to rapidnest-mate carrying behaviour [18]. Memory is therefore animportant part of the implementation of the decision, but antsfollowing the threshold rule do not need to invest in rememberingthe qualities or locations of multiple nests during the decision-making process.Figure 6.

The initial advantage is amplified by recruitment, and thiscan be shown to be sufficient to account for collective choice [24].In both the threshold rule and the recruitment latency hypothesis,a scout makes a probabilistic, quality-dependent decision aboutwhether to recruit each time she visits a nest. The differencebetween these mechanisms come from the assumptions madeabout what the scout does after leaving the nest, and how thisresults in a colony decision-mechanism. In our threshold rule, theant either commits or continues searching. In the recruitmentlatency hypothesis, ants which do not immediately start recruitingmay subsequently recruit, with a quality-dependent latency. In theoriginal formulation of this idea [20] it is mentioned that antsmight discover other nests during this latent period, but it is notsuggested that the latency is actually a result of the search for othernests. Searching for alternatives has a more prominent role in laterversions of the recruitment latency model [24] making it moresimilar to our threshold model, however, the idea of simplequality-dependent recruitment latencies functioning as a choicemechanism still appears often in discussions of collective decision-making [11,38,39]. There are two empirical problems with such amechanism. Firstly, colonies are able to choose a good nest, evenwhen it is so much further away than a poor nest that travel timeshould cancel out differences in recruitment latency [27]. Sec-ondly, all empirical evidence for quality-dependent recruitmentlatencies comes from studies offering a colony just one new nest[20,22,24,28]. When recruitment latencies are measured inmultiple nest experiments, no quality-dependent recruitmentlatencies differences are observed [this study and 26]. We usedmodelling to investigate these empirical results. Our simulationand analytical results reproduce quality-dependent recruitmentlatency in a single-nest experiment, but show that the presence ofan extra nest disrupts the quality-dependence of the latency tocommitment and recruitment (Figs. 5\\u20136). When a single poor nestis offered, acceptance times in the model will be geometricallydistributed, with few ants accepting the site early due to rareassessment errors or low individual-thresholds, and the remaindercontinuing to re-assess the same site until they eventually decide itis good enough. When a second higher quality site is introduced,the same small proportion of ants will accept the poor site earlydue to low-threshold or assessment error, but the remainder willnow tend to discover the alternative, superior site, and recruitto this quickly on average because of its increased quality. Thesame pattern would be observed for a threshold-rule with directcomparison (see Text S1), and also for a quality-dependent re-cruitment latency-rule, if it is assumed that ants search foralternatives during the latency period and have a high probabilityof finding other sites [20]. However, these alternative models areless parsimonious, requiring ants to remember the qualities and/orlocations of visited sites and evaluate this in making subsequentcomparisons or use the information to decide when and where tostart recruiting. These results also clearly demonstrate that aphenomenon observed when only one option is available, cannotbe assumed to function in the same way when choosing betweenmultiple options (see also [7]).Another well-studied example of collective decision-making isnest-site choice by swarming honeybees (Apis mellifera). Like antcolonies, bee swarms are able to choose between different nestsites, and individual bees do not need to have visited multiple sitesfor the swarm to be able to choose between them [40]. However,the way the scouts act on this information differs between the twogroups. The ants seem to use a binary decision process to eitheraccept that nest or continue searching. Ants accepting a nestrecruit others, causing a positive feedback process, but ant scoutsdo not modulate their recruitment according to nest quality, e.g.by recruiting at a faster rate or for longer to a higher quality nest[20,26]. In contrast, bees use a graded process, whereby scoutsinitially discovering a new nest-site almost always recruit [41],but the duration and rate of the recruiting waggle-dances aredependent on nest quality [42]. This means that more recruits arebrought to better nest-sites, leading to a positive feedback processusually resulting in a unanimous choice of the better site [42]. Onepossible reason for this difference in strategy could be differencesin nest availability: if suitable honeybee nest sites are relativelyrare, then it might be better for scouts to avoid ever rejecting apotential nest outright.Collective decisions are also made in other contexts, such aschoice of foraging site. Here again, comparisons of sites by indi-viduals seems to play little role. Foraging honeybees do not com-pare food sources [43], nor do they compare the waggle-dances ofrecruiters at the hive [44]. Rather, multiple sites \\u2018compete\\u2019 forforagers, with bees foraging more persistently at high quality sitesand recruiting to them more energetically [43,45]. Foragers canalso directly inhibit recruitment if they perceive danger at a par-ticular food source by the use of \\u2018stop-signals\\u2019 directed at beesrecruiting to that source [46]. In trail-laying ants and bees,pheromone trails to better foraging sites are more stronglyreinforced and this again leads to a collective choice without anynecessity for individuals to visit multiple sites [47,48]. Just as fornest-site choice, foraging recruitment can either be graded (layingmore pheromone to a better food source, e.g. [47,49]) or a binarydecision (all-or-nothing recruitment, e.g. [50,51]).Direct comparison of alternatives is seen in a range of animalsand contexts, including foraging in scrub jays and humans [8,52],mate choice in bower-birds and dance-flies [53,54] and shellassessment by hermit crabs [55]. A best-of-n comparison strategywould maximise decision accuracy [2], so why do neither indi-vidual bees nor ants appear to use this strategy when foraging orchoosing a new home? One possibility is that multiple comparisonsare too cognitively complex for ant and bee brains. However,small insects including bees are competent at related cognitiveprocesses, including contextual learning, discrimination betweenstimuli and associative recall [56]. Male dance-flies compare thesize of potential mates before choosing [54], and there is evidenceto suggest that honeybee workers are capable of comparativeevaluation of flowers [57] and that lone T. rugatulus ant workers arecapable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are veryclose together [25]. There may, therefore, be reasons other thancognitive constraints for why relying on individual best-of-ncomparisons to inform collective choices does not appear to haveevolved as a decision mechanism in bees or ants. One possiblereason is that during their evolutionary history the ants havetypically been faced with decisions about whether to accept asingle option at a time, rather than simultaneously having in-formation about multiple options, and this has shaped theevolution of their decision process [7]. Another possible reason isthe potential speed advantage of avoiding a sampling period.Sampling periods can be costly [2,7] and pose the mathematicallycomplex problem of deciding how long to sample for beforestarting the decision process [58]. Avoiding best-of-n comparisonsallows a potentially vulnerable colony to select the first nestencountered, if it is good enough. Perhaps even more important isdistributing the decision-making process, relying less on informa-tion-processing by a single individual; rather allowing the decisionA Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981to emerge from a collective process to which even partly-informedindividuals can contribute. In this colony-level cognition, therelevant information about the environment is represented withinthe individuals in a colony, their actions and interactions. At thecollective level this generates new information: which nest thecolony should choose [59]. In both bees and ants, the informationheld by individuals is integrated into a colony choice by means of aquorum threshold, which triggers rapid implementation of thedecision [18,60]. Although the colony will usually choose the sitewhich reaches quorum first, this does not mean that the colony asa whole must \\u2018satisfice\\u2019, accepting the first nest surpassing someminimum standard. Using quality-dependent initiation (in Tem-nothorax ants) or modulation (in honeybees) of the recruitmentprocess leading to the attainment of a quorum, the colony in effectcarries out a concurrent but indirect collective comparison process,which may implement optimal decision-making through theactions of partly-informed individuals [61]. This ensures that thenest to reach a quorum first is also likely to be the best option, evenwhen there is an array of possible alternatives [16,42]. Thuswithout the individuals using a \\u2018best-of-n\\u2019 comparison strategy, thecolony is able to solve a \\u2018best-of-n\\u2019 challenge [16,62].A further possible advantage of avoiding individual directcomparisons is that it would remove the risk of \\u2018irrational\\u2019 decisionbehaviour at the individual level [26], associated with comparative,relative evaluation of options such as best-of-n, or sequentialcomparisons. Individuals following our proposed threshold rulemake an absolute evaluation of quality, and this evaluation of oneoption is not influenced by the other alternatives available, incontrast to the context-dependent decision-making used by manyother animals including humans [8,63,64]. Although at thecollective level, a comparison between options is effectively beingmade, a non-comparative individual-level mechanism for thisdecision could protect the colony from irrationality in decision-making. For example, emigrating T. albipennis colonies followrational transitivity patterns in decision making [16] and in therelated species T. curvispinosus and T. rugatulus, colonies seem to beimmune to irrational distractor effects from irrelevant alternatives[25,65]. Although work on T. rugatulus suggests that this collectiveimmunity can emerge even if individuals are susceptible todistractor effects provided their individual contribution to thecollective decision is small [25], our work suggests this collectiverationality can emerge without depending on low numbers of antsvisiting both nests \\u2013 if individual ants follow the threshold rule, thenthe colony can escape these irrational comparison behaviours.Using an absolute evaluation method does have a potentialdrawback, if the acceptance threshold is not appropriate to theenvironment. When used in individual decision making (e.g.during mate choice in cockroaches, [9]) the success of this sort ofsequential search strategy will be highly sensitive to the thresholdused. For example, if all available options are poor quality, ananimal may reject them all, and end up worse off than if it hadaccepted a poor option. In contrast, when this strategy is used forgroup decision making, variation in acceptance thresholds acrossthe group provides protection against this sensitivity. If all optionsare poor quality, some low-threshold individuals will still acceptone, allowing the group to make a choice. Similarly, intra-colonyvariation in task response thresholds promotes effective division oflabour in social insect colonies, with more individuals engaging ina particular task when the stimulus for that task increases [66\\u201368].Our model assumes that individual thresholds are fixed over thetime-scale of the emigration process, however further flexibilitywould be available if acceptance thresholds were updated based onexperience over the course of an individual\\u2019s life-time [69,70].Flexible task thresholds promote flexible division of labour in socialinsect colonies [71\\u201373]. How much acceptance threshold variationactually occurs within a colony, and whether ant acceptancethresholds are fixed throughout life or changed by experience, areissues remaining to be explored.In summary, our simple individual-threshold model is sufficientto explain empirical decision-making data, without assuming morecomplex behavioural mechanisms. Since the scientific methodgives preference to the more parsimonious model, this result showsthat care is needed in inferring individual behaviour from groupbehaviour. We propose that, in general, individual decision-makers can use this simple threshold rule to provide their groupwith an elegant solution to the problem of making a collectivechoice. This strategy allows the group to make a rational, well-informed and rapid decision.Supporting InformationFigure S1 \\u2018Expected decision time in a two-nest scenario.Expected time for an ant to accept any site across varying qualities(probabilities of acceptance) of sites A and B, calculated fromequation 2.(TIF)Figure S2 \\u2018Expected decision time in one-nest scenario.Expected time for an ant to accept any site, using the parametersof Figure 6, for the no-comparison threshold-rule of the main text(red), and for the direct-comparison threshold-rule describedabove (green).(TIF)Text S1 This supplementary model information coversdetails of model parameterisation for the analytical andsimulation modelling.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Decision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler, faster strategies to find a \\u2018good enough\\u2019 option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behaviours including foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study of a collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decision strategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possible decision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simple rule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can account parsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when available nests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. We present empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individual sequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able to effectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. This parsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making\",\n",

We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simplerule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can accountparsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when availablenests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. Wepresent empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individualsequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able toeffectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. Thisparsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making.Citation: Robinson EJH, Franks NR, Ellis S, Okuda S, Marshall JAR (2011) A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making.

The fitness benefits of choosing the best option mean thatdecision-making strategies will be subject to natural selection. Mul-tiple comparison or \\u2018best of n\\u2019 strategies perform most accurately,and are likely to be optimal when searching and sampling costs arelow, e.g. on a lek [1,2] and when long-term fitness implications ofthe decision are high, e.g. in home range selection [3]. In othersituations, e.g. during foraging, there can be substantial time coststo making accurate decisions [4,5], and these costs can be so greatas to make quicker less accurate decisions more efficient [6]. Ani-mals may be best served by using a simpler \\u2018rule of thumb\\u2019, whichreduces sampling time, but still ensures the option they choose isgood enough. One simple but effective strategy is sequential searchin which the animal keeps searching until it finds an option thatexceeds a threshold of acceptability [2,7]. This kind of fixed-threshold strategy is used in foraging [8], mate choice [9] andrefuge selection [10]. An intermediate strategy is to allow thresh-olds to be influenced by experience of previous options; in effectthis would cause a \\u2018sequential comparison\\u2019.Social animals make collective decisions between availableoptions, particularly about where the group spends its time. Whenmaking a shared collective decision, a group faces the challenges ofintegrating information from multiple individuals and managingthe different decision-preferences of group members [11]. Suchdecisions are influenced by individual information, conflicts ofinterest and time-constraints [12,13]. To understand how a col-lective decision is reached, the rules followed by contributingmembers of the group must be identified [14]. Emigrating socialinsects are a good model system for the study of collective decision-making, because all members share the aim of coming to a con-sensus about a new, good nest site as soon as possible, but theinformation about available site quality is distributed very un-evenly within the colony [15,16]. To investigate the mechanismof decision making, we used models of, and experiments on,emigrating cavity-nesting rock ants, Temnothorax albipennis.A colony emigration by rock ants begins with scouts searchingfor and assessing new sites. Successful scouts recruit nest-matesusing tandem running, in which an informed ant leads another tothe new site [17]. When the number of ants at a site reaches a\\u2018quorum threshold\\u2019, the ants switch to rapid transport behaviour tocarry the brood, queen and remaining nest-mates to the new nest[18]. Ant colonies discriminate between nest sites on the basis of arange of attributes including cavity dimensions, light level andentrance width [16,19]. Three possible mechanisms by which thecolony collectively chooses the better of two nests have beenproposed: i) comparison ii) recruitment latency iii) threshold rule.PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981First, ants could use a comparison strategy, in which ants that havevisited both nests would compare their qualities and recruit nest-mates only to the better one [20]. Second, ants visiting just onenest could determine how long they hesitate before recruiting nest-mates (recruitment latency) based on the nest quality [20]. Acombination of these two mechanisms has been used as the basis ofseveral decision models [18,21\\u201324]. Although lone T. rugatulus antworkers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites whichare very close together [25], the evidence for individual antsmaking direct comparisons between nests during colony emigra-tion is weak [26], and furthermore, ant colonies are able to choosea distant good nest over a nearby poor nest, when recruitmentlatency differences would be expected to be cancelled out by traveltime (Fig. 1a) [26,27]. The third possible mechanism of choice is asequential search strategy, based on a very simple rule of thumb, a\\u2018threshold rule\\u2019, by which an ant assesses a nest against her ownfixed quality threshold, and either accepts the nest and beginsrecruitment, or rejects it and continues searching [26]. Quality-dependent recruitment latency has been demonstrated empiricallyonly when colonies were presented with a single new nest and werenot required to make a choice [20,22,24,28]. Robinson et al. [26]hypothesized that these apparent recruitment latency effects couldemerge as a by-product of a threshold rule, because ants that finda low-quality nest will tend to reject it and continue searching,whereas ants that find a high quality nest will tend to accept it andbegin recruitment. In addition, Robinson et al. [26] hypothesizedthat the apparent comparison phenomenon in which ants thathave visited equidistant poor and good nests usually recruit only tothe good nest (Fig. 1b; [20]) can be explained more parsimoniouslywith a threshold rule in which the poor nest is rejected and for-gotten, then the good nest is discovered and accepted, rather thanrequiring individual ants to perform the more cognitively complextask of remembering and comparing the qualities of different nests.We aim to test the hypothesis that this simple parsimoniousmechanism (the threshold rule) is sufficient to reproduce observedempirical patterns of collective decision-making.Here we present a Markov-chain model of decision-making,based on a simple threshold rule. Our model ants search for nests,and compare those they find to an internal acceptance threshold,subject to assessment error. This model includes no memory ofprevious nests, and no ability to make direct comparisons betweenthe nests an ant has encountered. It also includes no explicitquality-dependent recruitment latency. We compare the results ofthis model to empirical results from two published studies and onenew experiment, to test whether our model can produce thequalitative patterns seen in the empirical data. By parameterizingour model as far as possible to previous experiments [20,26] wetest whether this simple threshold-rule is sufficient to explainapparent recruitment latency and comparison effects. We also usethe model to predict emigration behaviour in a new experimentthat presents an ant colony with three equidistant nests, one goodand two poor (Fig. 1c). We performed this experiment usingindividually radio-tagged ants to monitor individual-level behav-iour and compare our empirical results to the model predictions.We thus test whether a very simple individual-level \\u2018rule of thumb\\u2019is sufficient to explain sophisticated collective decision-making.MethodsModelTo investigate the proposed threshold rule, we present a verysimple model. As we are only concerned with independent dis-covery by scouts before recruitment commences, we examine thecolony\\u2019s decision process analytically and using Monte-Carlo sim-ulation, modelling ants as independent instantiations of a Markovprocess. Ants independently accept sites according to a probabilityspecified by the site\\u2019s quality and their individual threshold, other-wise they search randomly for a site to assess (Fig. 2). We havemodelled a discontinuous acceptance function here, but this couldbe relaxed to be a smooth (e.g. sigmoidal) function of differencebetween internal threshold and sampled quality, without qualita-tively affecting the results. The Markov process has five states:\\u2018assessing home site\\u2019, \\u2018assessing poor site\\u2019, \\u2018assessing good site\\u2019,\\u2018committed to poor site\\u2019, and \\u2018committed to good site\\u2019. Allindividuals start in the \\u2018assessing home site\\u2019 state but the home siteis considered uninhabitable in the model, and its quality is set toFigure 1.

A simulated ant continues searchinguntil it encounters a nest of a quality (b) exceeding the ant\\u2019s individualthreshold (a), taking into account assessment error (e). Ants may revisitthe same nest (with probability r), and do not have any memory ofpreviously visited nests.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019981.g002A Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981negative infinity, therefore an ant can never become committed toit. Ants can switch between the assessment states, but we assumethat once committed to a site an ant remains so and recruits nest-mates to its preferred option; the recruitment process is not mod-elled, and the \\u2018committed\\u2019 states are therefore absorbing states.For the Monte-Carlo simulations, we model nest quality accep-tance thresholds in the colony as a normally distributed randomvariable A, with some mean and variance. An individual simulatedant has a quality acceptance threshold a drawn at random fromthis distribution. It discovers its next nest by sampling from aprobability distribution specified by its current nest, arena size andshape, and the proximities of other available nest sites (Table 1);part of this distribution is determined by the probability r that arandomly searching scout rediscovers the site it has just been in.On discovering a site, the scout evaluates the quality of the currentnest site with some error e added, sampled from a standard normaldistribution (mean 0; standard deviation 1); this corresponds toerror in the scout\\u2019s quality assessment. If this sampled qualityexceeds the scout\\u2019s acceptance threshold then it becomes com-mitted to the site, otherwise it continues searching (Fig. 2). Accep-tance threshold distributions and nest qualities are given arbitraryvalues (Table 1), because individual probabilities of becomingcommitted to a nest are hard to estimate empirically, due to thedifficulties in accurately identifying commitment and in eliminat-ing the effects of interactions between ants. In the model, traveltimes between sites are sampled from normal distributions. Byparameterizing this model to empirical ant movement speed andspecific experimental arenas (Table 1), we can approximate theexpected time for each simulated ant to find each nest, and thetime from first finding a nest to becoming committed to it (the antmay visit other nests in between, or visit the same nest many timesbefore committing to it). This allows us to calculate recruitmentlatencies for comparison with empirical data. In the empiricalstudies, recruitment latency concerns the time from discovering anest to first recruiting to that nest. We do not include recruitmentin the model, so modelled recruitment latency concerns the timefrom discovering a nest to \\u2018accepting\\u2019 that nest. For real antcolonies, searching behaviour is much reduced when quorum isachieved; we truncate the simulated data at the time at whichquorum was achieved in the real experiment, to increase com-parability (see Text S1).Model Analysis. In addition to the simulation model de-scribed in this paper, we can derive analytic results for the pro-posed rule for switching between nests. To facilitate this analysiswe simplify the Markov process slightly from that used in theMonte-Carlo simulations, by discarding the state of assessing thehome site. The four states in the simplified Markov process arethus \\u2018assessing poor site\\u2019, \\u2018assessing good site\\u2019, \\u2018committed to poorsite\\u2019, and \\u2018committed to good site\\u2019, and the state transition matrixis (with states ordered as described above from top to bottom andfrom left to right)Q~(1{p)r (1{g)(1{r) 0 0(1{p)(1{r) (1{g)r 0 0p 0 1 00 g 0 10BBB@1CCCA, \\u00f01\\u00dewhere p is the average per-visit probability that an ant accepts thepoor site, g is the average per-visit probability that an ant acceptsthe good site, and r is the probability that a randomly searchingscout rediscovers the site it has just been in. These are colony-wideaverage probabilities that can easily be derived from the thresholdA and error N(0,1) distributions used in the Monte-Carlosimulation, if comparability is desired. The matrix Q in eq. 1can be understood as having a column corresponding to each stateTable 1.

Ofparticular relevance to our proposals is the analysis of the expectedtime for the Markov-process to reach any absorbing state, whenstarted in some particular non-absorbing state. If we assume bothcandidate nest sites are equally likely to be discovered first from thehome site, then the expected number of steps in the Markov-chainbefore commitment to either nest site is reached is given byE(time to accept any site)~4(1{r)z2r(pzg){p{g2((2r{1)pgz(1{r)(pzg)): \\u00f02\\u00deEquation (2) will be used below to examine the sensitivity ofacceptance time to changes in site qualities. Note that, technically,we should be interested in the latency between discovering aparticular site, and recruiting to that site, however in general per-state latencies are difficult to calculate in Markov-chains, and theoverall expected latency given in equation 2 is an acceptable sim-plification (see Text S1).Empirical methodsEthics statement. Our experiments on T. albipennis andcollection of colonies from the field comply with the laws of thecountry in which they were carried out and the relevant nationaland international guidelines [30,31].\\u2018Three-New-Nests\\u2019 Experiment. Six T. albipennis colonieswere collected from the Dorset coast, England, June\\u2013July 2009.Colonies were queenright and contained 80\\u2013200 workers andbrood of all stages. Colonies were housed in artificial nests [27]and provided with water ad libitum and honey solution andDrosophila melanogaster weekly. We used these colonies to investigatedecision-making when a colony was offered a choice of three newnests. Six trials were performed, each with a new colony. One dayprior to an emigration trial, we attached an RFID micro-transponder (50065006120 mm) with a unique ID to the thoraxof every worker ant in the colony [32,33] and housed the colony ina nest formed of a hexagonal glass slide (edge length = 30 mm), a1.5 mm cardboard perimeter (cavity area 1496 mm2) and anacetate lid with a central entrance hole (1.5 mm diameter) to avoidintroducing directional bias. We performed trials in a circulararena with Fluon-coated sides, the floor of which was cleaned withwater and alcohol between trials. Three new hexagonal nests withthe same dimensions as the original nest were placed in the arena(Fig. 1c). Two nests had clear acetate lids and one had a red filtercovering the cavity area, making the nest appear relatively dark tothe ants [34]. Ant colonies choose dark over light nests [19]. Theposition of the good nest was interchanged between trials. Thenew nests had 1.5 mm wide entrances in the side facing the centreof the arena, over which RFID readers (PharmaSeq, Inc., NJ) wereplaced vertically. A trial began with the original nest placed in thecentre of the arena and then destroyed by removing the lid. TheRFID readers detected ants entering and leaving the new nests[86% tag read rate, 26] and we used handheld RFID readers toread the tags on tandem-running ants (94% tag read rate) as theycrossed half-way lines (Fig. 1c). The identity of the leader andfollower was thus recorded and the direction of the tandem runwas noted. This procedure does not disrupt tandem runs [26]. Thetime at which the transport by carrying of a nest-mate or a brooditem first occurred to each nest was recorded (i.e. the time at whichthe quorum threshold was reached). Once nest-mate transport hascommenced, the RFID system becomes less reliable [26], becausenest-mates are transported in such a way as to block the RFID tag.We therefore focused our analysis on searching and recruitment bytandem-running during the pre-quorum period. We observedemigrations until complete (old nest empty of brood and workers)and recorded the nest choice of the colony after 24 hours. Colo-nies were considered to have split if brood was present in two ormore nests.Statistical MethodsMean recruitment latencies were analysed using generalisedlinear mixed models (GLMM) \\u2018glmmPQL\\u2019 in the MASS library inR 2.4.1 with nest quality as a fixed factor, colony (empirical results)or replicate (simulation results) as a random factor and a Poissonerror structure. Differences between recruitment latency survivor-ship curves, were tested using generalized log-rank tests using thefunction \\u2018survdiff\\u2019 in the survival library in R 2.4.1. Monte Carlosimulations were carried out using MatLab 7.4.0 (see Text S1),and matrix manipulation with Maple 14.ResultsComparison with Poor Nest Near; Good Nest Far DataWe parameterized the model to the experimental set-up used byRobinson et al. [26] with a nearby poor nest and a more distantgood nest (Table 1, Fig. 1a) and performed Monte Carlo simu-lations of this experiment. The switching behaviour (ants movingfrom visiting one nest to visiting the other) in the simulations isqualitatively very similar to the empirical data (Fig. 3). In bothcases most ants that find the far (good) nest first stay at that nest,whereas ants that find the near (poor) nest first may stay or switch.The model simulations also reproduce the empirical results thatrecruitment latency does not play an important role here. In theempirical study, recruitment latency was measured as time fromdiscovering a nest to first leading a tandem run to that nest anddata are only available for ants which recruited by tandem-running. There are more recruitment latencies for the simulateddata, as all ants make a choice in the model, whereas in the realdata not all active ants perform tandem runs. This leads toquantitative differences between simulated and empirical data, butqualitatively the patterns are the same: In the simulated data, as inthe empirical data, there are no significant differences betweenrecruitment latencies to the good and poor nests (Fig. 4a, 4b).However, in a simulation presenting the two nests separately (i.e.either only old nest and near poor nest are present, or only old nestand far good nest are present) the pattern is dramatically different,with significantly higher recruitment latencies for the poor nest(Fig. 4c). This clearly demonstrates that differences in recruitmentlatency can be generated when only one nest is present, as a side-effect of the threshold rule.Comparison with Two-Equidistant-Nests DataTo test whether our model can account for the patterns seen inthe original experiments, used as evidence for the recruitmentlatency and comparison mechanisms [20], we also parameterisedthe Monte Carlo model to this experimental set-up (Fig. 1b,Table 1). Here two equidistant new nests, one good and one poor,are presented to the ant colony. The empirical data for directcomparison are shown in Table 2. Very similar results emerge inour simulations, without any memory or comparison coded intothe model (Table 2), clearly showing that this sort of behaviouralpattern can be accounted for by the threshold rule alone, withoutA Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981needing to include other mechanisms. However, the exact quan-titative results of our simulations are influenced by the acceptancethreshold and nest quality parameters. Since we do not know theshape of the real threshold distribution in an ant colony, the matchbetween simulated and empirical data here does not prove thatcomparison plays no role in ant decision-making, but does showthat results of this type do not necessarily have to be the producedby comparative evaluation.In the empirical data (Fig. 5a\\u2013f), there do appear to be quality-dependent differences in recruitment latency \\u2013 however, the nestswere presented separately in these experiments. Recruitmentlatency is measured using survival analysis, treating ants that find asite but never recruit to it as censored data. Applying the sameanalysis to our simulated results demonstrates that we can repli-cate these differences in recruitment latency when the nests arepresented separately (Fig. 5g\\u2013l) but the differences disappear whenthe simulations are repeated identically, but with the nestspresented together (Fig. 5m\\u2013r). This is same pattern as wasobserved in the comparison with the the \\u2018poor nest near; good nestfar\\u2019 data, even though recruitment latencies are measureddifferently in the two empirical studies. These simulation resultsdemonstrate that the observed empirical differences in recruitmentFigure 3. Comparison of empirical and simulated emigration behavior. Number of ants continuing to visit the same nest (stay) or going onto visit the other nest (switch), depends on the quality of the first nest visited. (A) Empirical results, 9 colonies, mean + SD.

We consider the two site case first; todo this we shall hold one of the nest site qualities constant whilevarying the other nest site quality, and examine the effect on theexpected time to reach commitment to either site. Figure 6illustrates how expected decision time varies for the one and twosite cases, for a given revisiting value of r (0.7, estimated fromempirical data). We vary the quality of the poor site (A) whilekeeping the quality of the good site (B) constant, holding g constantwhile varying p in the interval [0, 1] (see eq. 2). For a moderatequality of the constant nest (P(accept B) = g=0.88, estimated fromempirical data) expected decision time varies little between theextremes of the other nest\\u2019s quality (P(accept A) = p=0 to 1), thuswhen two nest sites are present, strong quality dependent recruit-ment latency is not evident (Fig. 6, solid line). This contrastsmarkedly with the situation where there is only one potential nestsite; this is equivalent to setting p= g in equation 2. Now a muchmore pronounced relationship between the quality of this site, andthe expected time until commitment, is evident (Fig. 6, dashedline). These analytic results agree qualitatively with results fromthe Monte-Carlo simulation (Fig. 5). This is good evidence forthe threshold rule, but does not in itself rule out sequential com-parisons since a version of the model with sequential comparisonsgives almost indistinguishable results (see Text S1, Fig. S2). How-ever, the sequential comparison model makes greater cognitivedemands on individuals, who must remember the qualities ofvisited sites and evaluate this in making subsequent comparisons.Three-New-Nests: Simulation Predictions and EmpiricalDataA total of 752 ants (across 6 colonies) were individually radio-tagged and their scouting activity was monitored during emi-gration experiments in which each colony chose between onegood and two poor nests (Fig. 1c). According to the thresholdrule, ants which independently (i.e. not by following a tandemrun) visit the good nest (A) and one of the poor nests (designatedB) and then visited another nest before quorum was reached (atwhich point carrying behaviour begins), should be equally likelyto return to good nest A or discover the other, equidistant, poornest (designated C). In contrast, if ants are using best-of-n directcomparisons, ants which have visited good nest A and then nest Bshould be more likely to return to A than to discover C.In the empirical data, 20 individuals out of the 752 wemonitored fulfilled the necessary behavioural criteria of finding Aand then B before quorum was reached. This sample size is smallbecause this behaviour was fairly rare \\u2013 as would be predicted byour model, ants finding A tended to start recruiting, rather thandiscover B. Using this sample size of 20 ants for 100 simulationreplicates gives 95% confidence intervals of 7\\u201312 ants returning toA; 8\\u201313 ants discovering C. The empirical data fit well withinthese limits, with 11 ants returning to A and 9 discovering C. Thisdoes not differ significantly from random choice (binomial test,P=0.82). This supports the threshold hypothesis and shows noevidence that ants act on information from comparison of nests toallow them to preferentially return to a better nest.Although our data show that ants did not preferentially returnto the good nest, the comparison hypothesis could still be sup-ported if those that did return to it did so more directly becausethey had remembered its high quality. This is not the case: antsmade 0\\u201327 (median= 3) repeat visits to B before returning to A,compared to 0\\u20136 (median= 0) visits to B before discovering C(Mann-Whitney test: U=73, N=20, P=0.07). The trend is in theopposite direction to that predicted by the hypothesis that antsmake a comparison and act on it to return more directly to betternests. These data are consistent with threshold-based choice.A second test of whether individual ants are comparing nestsinvolves decisions to recruit nest-mates by leading a tandem-runto the new nest. If ants are using a \\u2018best-of-n\\u2019 comparison strategy,the sampling period before recruiting should be independent ofthe quality of the first nest they visit, whereas if ants use aninternal threshold rule, the number of nests they sample beforerecruiting should be strongly dependent on the quality of the firstnest they visit, with ants that find the high quality nest first beinglikely to initiate recruitment to this nest immediately. In theempirical data, 13 individual ants initiated recruitment by leadinga tandem run, of which 8 had discovered the good nest first, and 5had discovered a poor nest first. Using these sample sizes for 100simulation replicates predicts that ants finding the good nest firstshould not visit any other nest before recruiting (median totalnests visited: 95%CI 1-1) whereas ants finding the poor nest firstshould be more likely to visit other nests before recruiting (mediantotal nests visited 95%CI 1-2). The empirical data fit thesepredictions. Ants which found the good nest first visited a medianof only that 1 nest before recruiting, whereas those which foundthe poor nest visited a median of 2 different nests before leading atandem run (Mann-Whitney test, U=36, N=13, P,0.05). Thedata do not support the recruitment latency mechanism, as thereare no quality-dependent differences in time from nest discov-ery to recruitment by tandem-running (good nest: mean 6SD= 20619 min; poor nest: mean 6 SD=28624 min; t-test:t12=0.71, P=0.49).DiscussionOur results show that a very simple individual mechanism canproduce effective collective decision-making. The predictions ofour threshold decision-making model correspond well withempirical data from house-hunting ants. Our simulations of theTable 2.

This explanationof empirical data is supported by our analytical modelling results.Our results clearly support the hypothesis that this simple par-simonious mechanism (the threshold rule) is sufficient to reproduceobserved empirical patterns of collective decision-making: ourresults can account for both apparent direct comparison of nestquality and for apparent quality-dependent recruitment latency,which had been previously proposed as mechanisms of collectivechoice. Our parsimonious threshold model is sufficient to explainthe data without assuming more complex behavioural mecha-nisms. This highlights the need for carefully designed experimentsto determine whether or not individuals make comparisons, anddemonstrates that group-level comparison behaviour does notnecessarily imply individual-level comparison behaviour. In thecase of ants, evidence of the ability of lone individuals to makedirect comparisons of alternatives has only recently been published[25]; as our results show, previously published studies were notsufficient to demonstrate this. Further empirical investigation isrequired to establish what role, if any, direct comparison by in-dividual ants plays in the collective decision-process.We can subdivide comparison behaviour into two types thatcan aid decision-making: best-of-n comparisons and sequentialcomparisons. Best-of-n comparison mechanisms are characterisedby a sampling period, and preferential return to the best option[35]. We conducted a multiple-nest experiment to test directly ifreal ants show these behaviours. Neither is observed. In contrast,the results support the threshold model: if the first nest theyencountered was of a high quality, the ants started recruitmentimmediately without continuing to sample, and those ants whichhad the opportunity to compare nests did not act on this infor-mation by preferential or more direct return to better nests.Sequential comparisons occur when each time an animal en-counters a new option, it compares the new option to its memoryof previously encountered options and is more likely to accept thenew one if it compares favourably. This is similar to the thresholdmodel, but thresholds are influenced by experience. In one variantof this, individuals sample several options and then accept the nextoption they encounter which exceeds the quality of all previousoptions. This strategy can be shown to provide the optimalsolution to the \\u2018secretary problem\\u2019; a sequential search problem inwhich previously encountered options are subsequently unavail-able [36]. We modelled a sequential comparison mechanism (seeText S1) to compare with our threshold model. The results showthat this type of comparison model predicts similar recruitmentlatency results to our threshold model. We therefore cannot ruleout this sequential comparison mechanism, but note that it is a lessparsimonious solution. Our threshold model is sufficient to explainthe data without invoking memory and comparison during thedecision process.Our simulated ants have no memory of previously visited nests,and yet behaviour previously described as \\u2018comparison\\u2019 stillemerges in our simulations (Table 2). This clearly shows thatempirical data of this sort cannot be used as evidence that ananimal is really remembering and comparing. The decisionprocess we propose is \\u2018memoryless\\u2019 in the sense that individualants do not have to remember previously visited alternativesduring their search for an acceptable nest. Our model deals onlywith the decision process up to the point at which an ant accepts anest. After that point, real ants clearly do use memory of nestlocation in order to recruit nest-mates to that nest by tandem-running [20]. Recruitment is the most easily identifiable actionindicating commitment, but ants that have accepted a nest mayalso act on their commitment by making repeat visits to the nest[26,37]. By making repeat visits, ants are able to assess nest areamore accurately [37] and would also contribute to the accumu-lation of a quorum at their chosen nest, causing the switch to rapidnest-mate carrying behaviour [18]. Memory is therefore animportant part of the implementation of the decision, but antsfollowing the threshold rule do not need to invest in rememberingthe qualities or locations of multiple nests during the decision-making process.Figure 6.

The initial advantage is amplified by recruitment, and thiscan be shown to be sufficient to account for collective choice [24].In both the threshold rule and the recruitment latency hypothesis,a scout makes a probabilistic, quality-dependent decision aboutwhether to recruit each time she visits a nest. The differencebetween these mechanisms come from the assumptions madeabout what the scout does after leaving the nest, and how thisresults in a colony decision-mechanism. In our threshold rule, theant either commits or continues searching. In the recruitmentlatency hypothesis, ants which do not immediately start recruitingmay subsequently recruit, with a quality-dependent latency. In theoriginal formulation of this idea [20] it is mentioned that antsmight discover other nests during this latent period, but it is notsuggested that the latency is actually a result of the search for othernests. Searching for alternatives has a more prominent role in laterversions of the recruitment latency model [24] making it moresimilar to our threshold model, however, the idea of simplequality-dependent recruitment latencies functioning as a choicemechanism still appears often in discussions of collective decision-making [11,38,39]. There are two empirical problems with such amechanism. Firstly, colonies are able to choose a good nest, evenwhen it is so much further away than a poor nest that travel timeshould cancel out differences in recruitment latency [27]. Sec-ondly, all empirical evidence for quality-dependent recruitmentlatencies comes from studies offering a colony just one new nest[20,22,24,28]. When recruitment latencies are measured inmultiple nest experiments, no quality-dependent recruitmentlatencies differences are observed [this study and 26]. We usedmodelling to investigate these empirical results. Our simulationand analytical results reproduce quality-dependent recruitmentlatency in a single-nest experiment, but show that the presence ofan extra nest disrupts the quality-dependence of the latency tocommitment and recruitment (Figs. 5\\u20136). When a single poor nestis offered, acceptance times in the model will be geometricallydistributed, with few ants accepting the site early due to rareassessment errors or low individual-thresholds, and the remaindercontinuing to re-assess the same site until they eventually decide itis good enough. When a second higher quality site is introduced,the same small proportion of ants will accept the poor site earlydue to low-threshold or assessment error, but the remainder willnow tend to discover the alternative, superior site, and recruitto this quickly on average because of its increased quality. Thesame pattern would be observed for a threshold-rule with directcomparison (see Text S1), and also for a quality-dependent re-cruitment latency-rule, if it is assumed that ants search foralternatives during the latency period and have a high probabilityof finding other sites [20]. However, these alternative models areless parsimonious, requiring ants to remember the qualities and/orlocations of visited sites and evaluate this in making subsequentcomparisons or use the information to decide when and where tostart recruiting. These results also clearly demonstrate that aphenomenon observed when only one option is available, cannotbe assumed to function in the same way when choosing betweenmultiple options (see also [7]).Another well-studied example of collective decision-making isnest-site choice by swarming honeybees (Apis mellifera). Like antcolonies, bee swarms are able to choose between different nestsites, and individual bees do not need to have visited multiple sitesfor the swarm to be able to choose between them [40]. However,the way the scouts act on this information differs between the twogroups. The ants seem to use a binary decision process to eitheraccept that nest or continue searching. Ants accepting a nestrecruit others, causing a positive feedback process, but ant scoutsdo not modulate their recruitment according to nest quality, e.g.by recruiting at a faster rate or for longer to a higher quality nest[20,26]. In contrast, bees use a graded process, whereby scoutsinitially discovering a new nest-site almost always recruit [41],but the duration and rate of the recruiting waggle-dances aredependent on nest quality [42]. This means that more recruits arebrought to better nest-sites, leading to a positive feedback processusually resulting in a unanimous choice of the better site [42]. Onepossible reason for this difference in strategy could be differencesin nest availability: if suitable honeybee nest sites are relativelyrare, then it might be better for scouts to avoid ever rejecting apotential nest outright.Collective decisions are also made in other contexts, such aschoice of foraging site. Here again, comparisons of sites by indi-viduals seems to play little role. Foraging honeybees do not com-pare food sources [43], nor do they compare the waggle-dances ofrecruiters at the hive [44]. Rather, multiple sites \\u2018compete\\u2019 forforagers, with bees foraging more persistently at high quality sitesand recruiting to them more energetically [43,45]. Foragers canalso directly inhibit recruitment if they perceive danger at a par-ticular food source by the use of \\u2018stop-signals\\u2019 directed at beesrecruiting to that source [46]. In trail-laying ants and bees,pheromone trails to better foraging sites are more stronglyreinforced and this again leads to a collective choice without anynecessity for individuals to visit multiple sites [47,48]. Just as fornest-site choice, foraging recruitment can either be graded (layingmore pheromone to a better food source, e.g. [47,49]) or a binarydecision (all-or-nothing recruitment, e.g. [50,51]).Direct comparison of alternatives is seen in a range of animalsand contexts, including foraging in scrub jays and humans [8,52],mate choice in bower-birds and dance-flies [53,54] and shellassessment by hermit crabs [55]. A best-of-n comparison strategywould maximise decision accuracy [2], so why do neither indi-vidual bees nor ants appear to use this strategy when foraging orchoosing a new home? One possibility is that multiple comparisonsare too cognitively complex for ant and bee brains. However,small insects including bees are competent at related cognitiveprocesses, including contextual learning, discrimination betweenstimuli and associative recall [56]. Male dance-flies compare thesize of potential mates before choosing [54], and there is evidenceto suggest that honeybee workers are capable of comparativeevaluation of flowers [57] and that lone T. rugatulus ant workers arecapable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are veryclose together [25]. There may, therefore, be reasons other thancognitive constraints for why relying on individual best-of-ncomparisons to inform collective choices does not appear to haveevolved as a decision mechanism in bees or ants. One possiblereason is that during their evolutionary history the ants havetypically been faced with decisions about whether to accept asingle option at a time, rather than simultaneously having in-formation about multiple options, and this has shaped theevolution of their decision process [7]. Another possible reason isthe potential speed advantage of avoiding a sampling period.Sampling periods can be costly [2,7] and pose the mathematicallycomplex problem of deciding how long to sample for beforestarting the decision process [58]. Avoiding best-of-n comparisonsallows a potentially vulnerable colony to select the first nestencountered, if it is good enough. Perhaps even more important isdistributing the decision-making process, relying less on informa-tion-processing by a single individual; rather allowing the decisionA Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981to emerge from a collective process to which even partly-informedindividuals can contribute. In this colony-level cognition, therelevant information about the environment is represented withinthe individuals in a colony, their actions and interactions. At thecollective level this generates new information: which nest thecolony should choose [59]. In both bees and ants, the informationheld by individuals is integrated into a colony choice by means of aquorum threshold, which triggers rapid implementation of thedecision [18,60]. Although the colony will usually choose the sitewhich reaches quorum first, this does not mean that the colony asa whole must \\u2018satisfice\\u2019, accepting the first nest surpassing someminimum standard. Using quality-dependent initiation (in Tem-nothorax ants) or modulation (in honeybees) of the recruitmentprocess leading to the attainment of a quorum, the colony in effectcarries out a concurrent but indirect collective comparison process,which may implement optimal decision-making through theactions of partly-informed individuals [61]. This ensures that thenest to reach a quorum first is also likely to be the best option, evenwhen there is an array of possible alternatives [16,42]. Thuswithout the individuals using a \\u2018best-of-n\\u2019 comparison strategy, thecolony is able to solve a \\u2018best-of-n\\u2019 challenge [16,62].A further possible advantage of avoiding individual directcomparisons is that it would remove the risk of \\u2018irrational\\u2019 decisionbehaviour at the individual level [26], associated with comparative,relative evaluation of options such as best-of-n, or sequentialcomparisons. Individuals following our proposed threshold rulemake an absolute evaluation of quality, and this evaluation of oneoption is not influenced by the other alternatives available, incontrast to the context-dependent decision-making used by manyother animals including humans [8,63,64]. Although at thecollective level, a comparison between options is effectively beingmade, a non-comparative individual-level mechanism for thisdecision could protect the colony from irrationality in decision-making. For example, emigrating T. albipennis colonies followrational transitivity patterns in decision making [16] and in therelated species T. curvispinosus and T. rugatulus, colonies seem to beimmune to irrational distractor effects from irrelevant alternatives[25,65]. Although work on T. rugatulus suggests that this collectiveimmunity can emerge even if individuals are susceptible todistractor effects provided their individual contribution to thecollective decision is small [25], our work suggests this collectiverationality can emerge without depending on low numbers of antsvisiting both nests \\u2013 if individual ants follow the threshold rule, thenthe colony can escape these irrational comparison behaviours.Using an absolute evaluation method does have a potentialdrawback, if the acceptance threshold is not appropriate to theenvironment. When used in individual decision making (e.g.during mate choice in cockroaches, [9]) the success of this sort ofsequential search strategy will be highly sensitive to the thresholdused. For example, if all available options are poor quality, ananimal may reject them all, and end up worse off than if it hadaccepted a poor option. In contrast, when this strategy is used forgroup decision making, variation in acceptance thresholds acrossthe group provides protection against this sensitivity. If all optionsare poor quality, some low-threshold individuals will still acceptone, allowing the group to make a choice. Similarly, intra-colonyvariation in task response thresholds promotes effective division oflabour in social insect colonies, with more individuals engaging ina particular task when the stimulus for that task increases [66\\u201368].Our model assumes that individual thresholds are fixed over thetime-scale of the emigration process, however further flexibilitywould be available if acceptance thresholds were updated based onexperience over the course of an individual\\u2019s life-time [69,70].Flexible task thresholds promote flexible division of labour in socialinsect colonies [71\\u201373]. How much acceptance threshold variationactually occurs within a colony, and whether ant acceptancethresholds are fixed throughout life or changed by experience, areissues remaining to be explored.In summary, our simple individual-threshold model is sufficientto explain empirical decision-making data, without assuming morecomplex behavioural mechanisms. Since the scientific methodgives preference to the more parsimonious model, this result showsthat care is needed in inferring individual behaviour from groupbehaviour. We propose that, in general, individual decision-makers can use this simple threshold rule to provide their groupwith an elegant solution to the problem of making a collectivechoice. This strategy allows the group to make a rational, well-informed and rapid decision.Supporting InformationFigure S1 \\u2018Expected decision time in a two-nest scenario.Expected time for an ant to accept any site across varying qualities(probabilities of acceptance) of sites A and B, calculated fromequation 2.(TIF)Figure S2 \\u2018Expected decision time in one-nest scenario.Expected time for an ant to accept any site, using the parametersof Figure 6, for the no-comparison threshold-rule of the main text(red), and for the direct-comparison threshold-rule describedabove (green).(TIF)Text S1 This supplementary model information coversdetails of model parameterisation for the analytical andsimulation modelling.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Decision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler, faster strategies to find a 'good enough' option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behaviours including foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study of a collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decision strategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possible decision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simple rule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can account parsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when available nests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. We present empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individual sequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able to effectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. This parsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Decision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler, faster strategies to find a 'good enough' option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behaviours including foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study of a collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decision strategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possible decision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simple rule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can account parsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when available nests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. We present empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individual sequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able to effectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. This parsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Decision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler, faster strategies to find a ‘good enough’ option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behaviours including foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study of a collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decision strategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possible decision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simple rule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can account parsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when available nests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. We present empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individual sequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able to effectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. This parsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making',\n",

Marshall31 School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom, 2 York Centre for Complex Systems Analysis, Department of Biology, University of York, York,United Kingdom, 3Department of Computer Science and Kroto Research Institute, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United KingdomAbstractDecision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler,faster strategies to find a ‘good enough’ option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behavioursincluding foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study ofa collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decisionstrategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possibledecision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simplerule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can accountparsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when availablenests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. Wepresent empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individualsequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able toeffectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. Thisparsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making.Citation: Robinson EJH, Franks NR, Ellis S, Okuda S, Marshall JAR (2011) A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making.

The fitness benefits of choosing the best option mean thatdecision-making strategies will be subject to natural selection. Mul-tiple comparison or ‘best of n’ strategies perform most accurately,and are likely to be optimal when searching and sampling costs arelow, e.g. on a lek [1,2] and when long-term fitness implications ofthe decision are high, e.g. in home range selection [3]. In othersituations, e.g. during foraging, there can be substantial time coststo making accurate decisions [4,5], and these costs can be so greatas to make quicker less accurate decisions more efficient [6]. Ani-mals may be best served by using a simpler ‘rule of thumb’, whichreduces sampling time, but still ensures the option they choose isgood enough. One simple but effective strategy is sequential searchin which the animal keeps searching until it finds an option thatexceeds a threshold of acceptability [2,7]. This kind of fixed-threshold strategy is used in foraging [8], mate choice [9] andrefuge selection [10]. An intermediate strategy is to allow thresh-olds to be influenced by experience of previous options; in effectthis would cause a ‘sequential comparison’.Social animals make collective decisions between availableoptions, particularly about where the group spends its time. Whenmaking a shared collective decision, a group faces the challenges ofintegrating information from multiple individuals and managingthe different decision-preferences of group members [11]. Suchdecisions are influenced by individual information, conflicts ofinterest and time-constraints [12,13]. To understand how a col-lective decision is reached, the rules followed by contributingmembers of the group must be identified [14]. Emigrating socialinsects are a good model system for the study of collective decision-making, because all members share the aim of coming to a con-sensus about a new, good nest site as soon as possible, but theinformation about available site quality is distributed very un-evenly within the colony [15,16]. To investigate the mechanismof decision making, we used models of, and experiments on,emigrating cavity-nesting rock ants, Temnothorax albipennis.A colony emigration by rock ants begins with scouts searchingfor and assessing new sites. Successful scouts recruit nest-matesusing tandem running, in which an informed ant leads another tothe new site [17]. When the number of ants at a site reaches a‘quorum threshold’, the ants switch to rapid transport behaviour tocarry the brood, queen and remaining nest-mates to the new nest[18]. Ant colonies discriminate between nest sites on the basis of arange of attributes including cavity dimensions, light level andentrance width [16,19]. Three possible mechanisms by which thecolony collectively chooses the better of two nests have beenproposed: i) comparison ii) recruitment latency iii) threshold rule.PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981First, ants could use a comparison strategy, in which ants that havevisited both nests would compare their qualities and recruit nest-mates only to the better one [20]. Second, ants visiting just onenest could determine how long they hesitate before recruiting nest-mates (recruitment latency) based on the nest quality [20]. Acombination of these two mechanisms has been used as the basis ofseveral decision models [18,21–24]. Although lone T. rugatulus antworkers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites whichare very close together [25], the evidence for individual antsmaking direct comparisons between nests during colony emigra-tion is weak [26], and furthermore, ant colonies are able to choosea distant good nest over a nearby poor nest, when recruitmentlatency differences would be expected to be cancelled out by traveltime (Fig. 1a) [26,27]. The third possible mechanism of choice is asequential search strategy, based on a very simple rule of thumb, a‘threshold rule’, by which an ant assesses a nest against her ownfixed quality threshold, and either accepts the nest and beginsrecruitment, or rejects it and continues searching [26]. Quality-dependent recruitment latency has been demonstrated empiricallyonly when colonies were presented with a single new nest and werenot required to make a choice [20,22,24,28]. Robinson et al. [26]hypothesized that these apparent recruitment latency effects couldemerge as a by-product of a threshold rule, because ants that finda low-quality nest will tend to reject it and continue searching,whereas ants that find a high quality nest will tend to accept it andbegin recruitment. In addition, Robinson et al. [26] hypothesizedthat the apparent comparison phenomenon in which ants thathave visited equidistant poor and good nests usually recruit only tothe good nest (Fig. 1b; [20]) can be explained more parsimoniouslywith a threshold rule in which the poor nest is rejected and for-gotten, then the good nest is discovered and accepted, rather thanrequiring individual ants to perform the more cognitively complextask of remembering and comparing the qualities of different nests.We aim to test the hypothesis that this simple parsimoniousmechanism (the threshold rule) is sufficient to reproduce observedempirical patterns of collective decision-making.Here we present a Markov-chain model of decision-making,based on a simple threshold rule. Our model ants search for nests,and compare those they find to an internal acceptance threshold,subject to assessment error. This model includes no memory ofprevious nests, and no ability to make direct comparisons betweenthe nests an ant has encountered. It also includes no explicitquality-dependent recruitment latency. We compare the results ofthis model to empirical results from two published studies and onenew experiment, to test whether our model can produce thequalitative patterns seen in the empirical data. By parameterizingour model as far as possible to previous experiments [20,26] wetest whether this simple threshold-rule is sufficient to explainapparent recruitment latency and comparison effects. We also usethe model to predict emigration behaviour in a new experimentthat presents an ant colony with three equidistant nests, one goodand two poor (Fig. 1c). We performed this experiment usingindividually radio-tagged ants to monitor individual-level behav-iour and compare our empirical results to the model predictions.We thus test whether a very simple individual-level ‘rule of thumb’is sufficient to explain sophisticated collective decision-making.MethodsModelTo investigate the proposed threshold rule, we present a verysimple model. As we are only concerned with independent dis-covery by scouts before recruitment commences, we examine thecolony’s decision process analytically and using Monte-Carlo sim-ulation, modelling ants as independent instantiations of a Markovprocess. Ants independently accept sites according to a probabilityspecified by the site’s quality and their individual threshold, other-wise they search randomly for a site to assess (Fig. 2). We havemodelled a discontinuous acceptance function here, but this couldbe relaxed to be a smooth (e.g. sigmoidal) function of differencebetween internal threshold and sampled quality, without qualita-tively affecting the results. The Markov process has five states:‘assessing home site’, ‘assessing poor site’, ‘assessing good site’,‘committed to poor site’, and ‘committed to good site’. Allindividuals start in the ‘assessing home site’ state but the home siteis considered uninhabitable in the model, and its quality is set toFigure 1. Arenas used in emigration experiments, showing nestlocations. Dashed outline= old destroyed nest; shading= good nests.(A) Good nest 120 cm from old nest; poor nest 30 cm [26]. (B)Equidistant good and poor nests 45 cm from old nest [20]. (C) Threeequidistant new nests 36 cm from old nest. Dashed lines indicate pointsat which tandem-runs were recorded.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019981.g001Figure 2. Schematic of model. A simulated ant continues searchinguntil it encounters a nest of a quality (b) exceeding the ant’s individualthreshold (a), taking into account assessment error (e). Ants may revisitthe same nest (with probability r), and do not have any memory ofpreviously visited nests.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019981.g002A Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981negative infinity, therefore an ant can never become committed toit. Ants can switch between the assessment states, but we assumethat once committed to a site an ant remains so and recruits nest-mates to its preferred option; the recruitment process is not mod-elled, and the ‘committed’ states are therefore absorbing states.For the Monte-Carlo simulations, we model nest quality accep-tance thresholds in the colony as a normally distributed randomvariable A, with some mean and variance. An individual simulatedant has a quality acceptance threshold a drawn at random fromthis distribution. It discovers its next nest by sampling from aprobability distribution specified by its current nest, arena size andshape, and the proximities of other available nest sites (Table 1);part of this distribution is determined by the probability r that arandomly searching scout rediscovers the site it has just been in.On discovering a site, the scout evaluates the quality of the currentnest site with some error e added, sampled from a standard normaldistribution (mean 0; standard deviation 1); this corresponds toerror in the scout’s quality assessment. If this sampled qualityexceeds the scout’s acceptance threshold then it becomes com-mitted to the site, otherwise it continues searching (Fig. 2). Accep-tance threshold distributions and nest qualities are given arbitraryvalues (Table 1), because individual probabilities of becomingcommitted to a nest are hard to estimate empirically, due to thedifficulties in accurately identifying commitment and in eliminat-ing the effects of interactions between ants. In the model, traveltimes between sites are sampled from normal distributions. Byparameterizing this model to empirical ant movement speed andspecific experimental arenas (Table 1), we can approximate theexpected time for each simulated ant to find each nest, and thetime from first finding a nest to becoming committed to it (the antmay visit other nests in between, or visit the same nest many timesbefore committing to it). This allows us to calculate recruitmentlatencies for comparison with empirical data. In the empiricalstudies, recruitment latency concerns the time from discovering anest to first recruiting to that nest. We do not include recruitmentin the model, so modelled recruitment latency concerns the timefrom discovering a nest to ‘accepting’ that nest. For real antcolonies, searching behaviour is much reduced when quorum isachieved; we truncate the simulated data at the time at whichquorum was achieved in the real experiment, to increase com-parability (see Text S1).Model Analysis. In addition to the simulation model de-scribed in this paper, we can derive analytic results for the pro-posed rule for switching between nests. To facilitate this analysiswe simplify the Markov process slightly from that used in theMonte-Carlo simulations, by discarding the state of assessing thehome site. The four states in the simplified Markov process arethus ‘assessing poor site’, ‘assessing good site’, ‘committed to poorsite’, and ‘committed to good site’, and the state transition matrixis (with states ordered as described above from top to bottom andfrom left to right)Q~(1{p)r (1{g)(1{r) 0 0(1{p)(1{r) (1{g)r 0 0p 0 1 00 g 0 10BBB@1CCCA, ð1Þwhere p is the average per-visit probability that an ant accepts thepoor site, g is the average per-visit probability that an ant acceptsthe good site, and r is the probability that a randomly searchingscout rediscovers the site it has just been in. These are colony-wideaverage probabilities that can easily be derived from the thresholdA and error N(0,1) distributions used in the Monte-Carlosimulation, if comparability is desired. The matrix Q in eq. 1can be understood as having a column corresponding to each stateTable 1.

The probability distribution over theinitial states (‘assessing poor site’ and ‘assessing good site’) can bederived based on the relative probabilities of an arbitrary ant scoutdiscovering either when searching from the home site.Using standard techniques [e.g. 29] we derive analytic results onthe long-run behaviour of the threshold-switching rule, using thestate transition matrix Q (eq. 1) and its fundamental matrix. Ofparticular relevance to our proposals is the analysis of the expectedtime for the Markov-process to reach any absorbing state, whenstarted in some particular non-absorbing state. If we assume bothcandidate nest sites are equally likely to be discovered first from thehome site, then the expected number of steps in the Markov-chainbefore commitment to either nest site is reached is given byE(time to accept any site)~4(1{r)z2r(pzg){p{g2((2r{1)pgz(1{r)(pzg)): ð2ÞEquation (2) will be used below to examine the sensitivity ofacceptance time to changes in site qualities. Note that, technically,we should be interested in the latency between discovering aparticular site, and recruiting to that site, however in general per-state latencies are difficult to calculate in Markov-chains, and theoverall expected latency given in equation 2 is an acceptable sim-plification (see Text S1).Empirical methodsEthics statement. Our experiments on T. albipennis andcollection of colonies from the field comply with the laws of thecountry in which they were carried out and the relevant nationaland international guidelines [30,31].‘Three-New-Nests’ Experiment. Six T. albipennis colonieswere collected from the Dorset coast, England, June–July 2009.Colonies were queenright and contained 80–200 workers andbrood of all stages. Colonies were housed in artificial nests [27]and provided with water ad libitum and honey solution andDrosophila melanogaster weekly. We used these colonies to investigatedecision-making when a colony was offered a choice of three newnests. Six trials were performed, each with a new colony. One dayprior to an emigration trial, we attached an RFID micro-transponder (50065006120 mm) with a unique ID to the thoraxof every worker ant in the colony [32,33] and housed the colony ina nest formed of a hexagonal glass slide (edge length = 30 mm), a1.5 mm cardboard perimeter (cavity area 1496 mm2) and anacetate lid with a central entrance hole (1.5 mm diameter) to avoidintroducing directional bias. We performed trials in a circulararena with Fluon-coated sides, the floor of which was cleaned withwater and alcohol between trials. Three new hexagonal nests withthe same dimensions as the original nest were placed in the arena(Fig. 1c). Two nests had clear acetate lids and one had a red filtercovering the cavity area, making the nest appear relatively dark tothe ants [34]. Ant colonies choose dark over light nests [19]. Theposition of the good nest was interchanged between trials. Thenew nests had 1.5 mm wide entrances in the side facing the centreof the arena, over which RFID readers (PharmaSeq, Inc., NJ) wereplaced vertically. A trial began with the original nest placed in thecentre of the arena and then destroyed by removing the lid. TheRFID readers detected ants entering and leaving the new nests[86% tag read rate, 26] and we used handheld RFID readers toread the tags on tandem-running ants (94% tag read rate) as theycrossed half-way lines (Fig. 1c). The identity of the leader andfollower was thus recorded and the direction of the tandem runwas noted. This procedure does not disrupt tandem runs [26]. Thetime at which the transport by carrying of a nest-mate or a brooditem first occurred to each nest was recorded (i.e. the time at whichthe quorum threshold was reached). Once nest-mate transport hascommenced, the RFID system becomes less reliable [26], becausenest-mates are transported in such a way as to block the RFID tag.We therefore focused our analysis on searching and recruitment bytandem-running during the pre-quorum period. We observedemigrations until complete (old nest empty of brood and workers)and recorded the nest choice of the colony after 24 hours. Colo-nies were considered to have split if brood was present in two ormore nests.Statistical MethodsMean recruitment latencies were analysed using generalisedlinear mixed models (GLMM) ‘glmmPQL’ in the MASS library inR 2.4.1 with nest quality as a fixed factor, colony (empirical results)or replicate (simulation results) as a random factor and a Poissonerror structure. Differences between recruitment latency survivor-ship curves, were tested using generalized log-rank tests using thefunction ‘survdiff’ in the survival library in R 2.4.1. Monte Carlosimulations were carried out using MatLab 7.4.0 (see Text S1),and matrix manipulation with Maple 14.ResultsComparison with Poor Nest Near; Good Nest Far DataWe parameterized the model to the experimental set-up used byRobinson et al. [26] with a nearby poor nest and a more distantgood nest (Table 1, Fig. 1a) and performed Monte Carlo simu-lations of this experiment. The switching behaviour (ants movingfrom visiting one nest to visiting the other) in the simulations isqualitatively very similar to the empirical data (Fig. 3). In bothcases most ants that find the far (good) nest first stay at that nest,whereas ants that find the near (poor) nest first may stay or switch.The model simulations also reproduce the empirical results thatrecruitment latency does not play an important role here. In theempirical study, recruitment latency was measured as time fromdiscovering a nest to first leading a tandem run to that nest anddata are only available for ants which recruited by tandem-running. There are more recruitment latencies for the simulateddata, as all ants make a choice in the model, whereas in the realdata not all active ants perform tandem runs. This leads toquantitative differences between simulated and empirical data, butqualitatively the patterns are the same: In the simulated data, as inthe empirical data, there are no significant differences betweenrecruitment latencies to the good and poor nests (Fig. 4a, 4b).However, in a simulation presenting the two nests separately (i.e.either only old nest and near poor nest are present, or only old nestand far good nest are present) the pattern is dramatically different,with significantly higher recruitment latencies for the poor nest(Fig. 4c). This clearly demonstrates that differences in recruitmentlatency can be generated when only one nest is present, as a side-effect of the threshold rule.Comparison with Two-Equidistant-Nests DataTo test whether our model can account for the patterns seen inthe original experiments, used as evidence for the recruitmentlatency and comparison mechanisms [20], we also parameterisedthe Monte Carlo model to this experimental set-up (Fig. 1b,Table 1). Here two equidistant new nests, one good and one poor,are presented to the ant colony. The empirical data for directcomparison are shown in Table 2. Very similar results emerge inour simulations, without any memory or comparison coded intothe model (Table 2), clearly showing that this sort of behaviouralpattern can be accounted for by the threshold rule alone, withoutA Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981needing to include other mechanisms. However, the exact quan-titative results of our simulations are influenced by the acceptancethreshold and nest quality parameters. Since we do not know theshape of the real threshold distribution in an ant colony, the matchbetween simulated and empirical data here does not prove thatcomparison plays no role in ant decision-making, but does showthat results of this type do not necessarily have to be the producedby comparative evaluation.In the empirical data (Fig. 5a–f), there do appear to be quality-dependent differences in recruitment latency – however, the nestswere presented separately in these experiments. Recruitmentlatency is measured using survival analysis, treating ants that find asite but never recruit to it as censored data. Applying the sameanalysis to our simulated results demonstrates that we can repli-cate these differences in recruitment latency when the nests arepresented separately (Fig. 5g–l) but the differences disappear whenthe simulations are repeated identically, but with the nestspresented together (Fig. 5m–r). This is same pattern as wasobserved in the comparison with the the ‘poor nest near; good nestfar’ data, even though recruitment latencies are measureddifferently in the two empirical studies. These simulation resultsdemonstrate that the observed empirical differences in recruitmentFigure 3. Comparison of empirical and simulated emigration behavior. Number of ants continuing to visit the same nest (stay) or going onto visit the other nest (switch), depends on the quality of the first nest visited. (A) Empirical results, 9 colonies, mean + SD.

We consider the two site case first; todo this we shall hold one of the nest site qualities constant whilevarying the other nest site quality, and examine the effect on theexpected time to reach commitment to either site. Figure 6illustrates how expected decision time varies for the one and twosite cases, for a given revisiting value of r (0.7, estimated fromempirical data). We vary the quality of the poor site (A) whilekeeping the quality of the good site (B) constant, holding g constantwhile varying p in the interval [0, 1] (see eq. 2). For a moderatequality of the constant nest (P(accept B) = g=0.88, estimated fromempirical data) expected decision time varies little between theextremes of the other nest’s quality (P(accept A) = p=0 to 1), thuswhen two nest sites are present, strong quality dependent recruit-ment latency is not evident (Fig. 6, solid line). This contrastsmarkedly with the situation where there is only one potential nestsite; this is equivalent to setting p= g in equation 2. Now a muchmore pronounced relationship between the quality of this site, andthe expected time until commitment, is evident (Fig. 6, dashedline). These analytic results agree qualitatively with results fromthe Monte-Carlo simulation (Fig. 5). This is good evidence forthe threshold rule, but does not in itself rule out sequential com-parisons since a version of the model with sequential comparisonsgives almost indistinguishable results (see Text S1, Fig. S2). How-ever, the sequential comparison model makes greater cognitivedemands on individuals, who must remember the qualities ofvisited sites and evaluate this in making subsequent comparisons.Three-New-Nests: Simulation Predictions and EmpiricalDataA total of 752 ants (across 6 colonies) were individually radio-tagged and their scouting activity was monitored during emi-gration experiments in which each colony chose between onegood and two poor nests (Fig. 1c). According to the thresholdrule, ants which independently (i.e. not by following a tandemrun) visit the good nest (A) and one of the poor nests (designatedB) and then visited another nest before quorum was reached (atwhich point carrying behaviour begins), should be equally likelyto return to good nest A or discover the other, equidistant, poornest (designated C). In contrast, if ants are using best-of-n directcomparisons, ants which have visited good nest A and then nest Bshould be more likely to return to A than to discover C.In the empirical data, 20 individuals out of the 752 wemonitored fulfilled the necessary behavioural criteria of finding Aand then B before quorum was reached. This sample size is smallbecause this behaviour was fairly rare – as would be predicted byour model, ants finding A tended to start recruiting, rather thandiscover B. Using this sample size of 20 ants for 100 simulationreplicates gives 95% confidence intervals of 7–12 ants returning toA; 8–13 ants discovering C. The empirical data fit well withinthese limits, with 11 ants returning to A and 9 discovering C. Thisdoes not differ significantly from random choice (binomial test,P=0.82). This supports the threshold hypothesis and shows noevidence that ants act on information from comparison of nests toallow them to preferentially return to a better nest.Although our data show that ants did not preferentially returnto the good nest, the comparison hypothesis could still be sup-ported if those that did return to it did so more directly becausethey had remembered its high quality. This is not the case: antsmade 0–27 (median= 3) repeat visits to B before returning to A,compared to 0–6 (median= 0) visits to B before discovering C(Mann-Whitney test: U=73, N=20, P=0.07). The trend is in theopposite direction to that predicted by the hypothesis that antsmake a comparison and act on it to return more directly to betternests. These data are consistent with threshold-based choice.A second test of whether individual ants are comparing nestsinvolves decisions to recruit nest-mates by leading a tandem-runto the new nest. If ants are using a ‘best-of-n’ comparison strategy,the sampling period before recruiting should be independent ofthe quality of the first nest they visit, whereas if ants use aninternal threshold rule, the number of nests they sample beforerecruiting should be strongly dependent on the quality of the firstnest they visit, with ants that find the high quality nest first beinglikely to initiate recruitment to this nest immediately. In theempirical data, 13 individual ants initiated recruitment by leadinga tandem run, of which 8 had discovered the good nest first, and 5had discovered a poor nest first. Using these sample sizes for 100simulation replicates predicts that ants finding the good nest firstshould not visit any other nest before recruiting (median totalnests visited: 95%CI 1-1) whereas ants finding the poor nest firstshould be more likely to visit other nests before recruiting (mediantotal nests visited 95%CI 1-2). The empirical data fit thesepredictions. Ants which found the good nest first visited a medianof only that 1 nest before recruiting, whereas those which foundthe poor nest visited a median of 2 different nests before leading atandem run (Mann-Whitney test, U=36, N=13, P,0.05). Thedata do not support the recruitment latency mechanism, as thereare no quality-dependent differences in time from nest discov-ery to recruitment by tandem-running (good nest: mean 6SD= 20619 min; poor nest: mean 6 SD=28624 min; t-test:t12 = 0.71, P=0.49).DiscussionOur results show that a very simple individual mechanism canproduce effective collective decision-making. The predictions ofour threshold decision-making model correspond well withempirical data from house-hunting ants. Our simulations of theTable 2.

This explanationof empirical data is supported by our analytical modelling results.Our results clearly support the hypothesis that this simple par-simonious mechanism (the threshold rule) is sufficient to reproduceobserved empirical patterns of collective decision-making: ourresults can account for both apparent direct comparison of nestquality and for apparent quality-dependent recruitment latency,which had been previously proposed as mechanisms of collectivechoice. Our parsimonious threshold model is sufficient to explainthe data without assuming more complex behavioural mecha-nisms. This highlights the need for carefully designed experimentsto determine whether or not individuals make comparisons, anddemonstrates that group-level comparison behaviour does notnecessarily imply individual-level comparison behaviour. In thecase of ants, evidence of the ability of lone individuals to makedirect comparisons of alternatives has only recently been published[25]; as our results show, previously published studies were notsufficient to demonstrate this. Further empirical investigation isrequired to establish what role, if any, direct comparison by in-dividual ants plays in the collective decision-process.We can subdivide comparison behaviour into two types thatcan aid decision-making: best-of-n comparisons and sequentialcomparisons. Best-of-n comparison mechanisms are characterisedby a sampling period, and preferential return to the best option[35]. We conducted a multiple-nest experiment to test directly ifreal ants show these behaviours. Neither is observed. In contrast,the results support the threshold model: if the first nest theyencountered was of a high quality, the ants started recruitmentimmediately without continuing to sample, and those ants whichhad the opportunity to compare nests did not act on this infor-mation by preferential or more direct return to better nests.Sequential comparisons occur when each time an animal en-counters a new option, it compares the new option to its memoryof previously encountered options and is more likely to accept thenew one if it compares favourably. This is similar to the thresholdmodel, but thresholds are influenced by experience. In one variantof this, individuals sample several options and then accept the nextoption they encounter which exceeds the quality of all previousoptions. This strategy can be shown to provide the optimalsolution to the ‘secretary problem’; a sequential search problem inwhich previously encountered options are subsequently unavail-able [36]. We modelled a sequential comparison mechanism (seeText S1) to compare with our threshold model. The results showthat this type of comparison model predicts similar recruitmentlatency results to our threshold model. We therefore cannot ruleout this sequential comparison mechanism, but note that it is a lessparsimonious solution. Our threshold model is sufficient to explainthe data without invoking memory and comparison during thedecision process.Our simulated ants have no memory of previously visited nests,and yet behaviour previously described as ‘comparison’ stillemerges in our simulations (Table 2). This clearly shows thatempirical data of this sort cannot be used as evidence that ananimal is really remembering and comparing. The decisionprocess we propose is ‘memoryless’ in the sense that individualants do not have to remember previously visited alternativesduring their search for an acceptable nest. Our model deals onlywith the decision process up to the point at which an ant accepts anest. After that point, real ants clearly do use memory of nestlocation in order to recruit nest-mates to that nest by tandem-running [20]. Recruitment is the most easily identifiable actionindicating commitment, but ants that have accepted a nest mayalso act on their commitment by making repeat visits to the nest[26,37]. By making repeat visits, ants are able to assess nest areamore accurately [37] and would also contribute to the accumu-lation of a quorum at their chosen nest, causing the switch to rapidnest-mate carrying behaviour [18]. Memory is therefore animportant part of the implementation of the decision, but antsfollowing the threshold rule do not need to invest in rememberingthe qualities or locations of multiple nests during the decision-making process.Figure 6. Analytical results of Markov Chain model. Expectedtime for an ant to accept any site across varying qualities of site A,calculated from equation 2. Dashed line: only site A present. Solid line:two nests present; site B fixed at P(accept nest B) = 0.88 (estimated fromdata, see Text S1, Fig. S1). For two nests present, either site is equallylikely to be discovered first. Nest rediscovery probability r= 0.7(estimated from data, see Text S1, Table S1). The reduced effect ofsite A’s quality on expected decision time is robust to variations in siteB’s quality, except where this becomes low (see Fig. S1).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019981.g006Figure 5.

The initial advantage is amplified by recruitment, and thiscan be shown to be sufficient to account for collective choice [24].In both the threshold rule and the recruitment latency hypothesis,a scout makes a probabilistic, quality-dependent decision aboutwhether to recruit each time she visits a nest. The differencebetween these mechanisms come from the assumptions madeabout what the scout does after leaving the nest, and how thisresults in a colony decision-mechanism. In our threshold rule, theant either commits or continues searching. In the recruitmentlatency hypothesis, ants which do not immediately start recruitingmay subsequently recruit, with a quality-dependent latency. In theoriginal formulation of this idea [20] it is mentioned that antsmight discover other nests during this latent period, but it is notsuggested that the latency is actually a result of the search for othernests. Searching for alternatives has a more prominent role in laterversions of the recruitment latency model [24] making it moresimilar to our threshold model, however, the idea of simplequality-dependent recruitment latencies functioning as a choicemechanism still appears often in discussions of collective decision-making [11,38,39]. There are two empirical problems with such amechanism. Firstly, colonies are able to choose a good nest, evenwhen it is so much further away than a poor nest that travel timeshould cancel out differences in recruitment latency [27]. Sec-ondly, all empirical evidence for quality-dependent recruitmentlatencies comes from studies offering a colony just one new nest[20,22,24,28]. When recruitment latencies are measured inmultiple nest experiments, no quality-dependent recruitmentlatencies differences are observed [this study and 26]. We usedmodelling to investigate these empirical results. Our simulationand analytical results reproduce quality-dependent recruitmentlatency in a single-nest experiment, but show that the presence ofan extra nest disrupts the quality-dependence of the latency tocommitment and recruitment (Figs. 5–6). When a single poor nestis offered, acceptance times in the model will be geometricallydistributed, with few ants accepting the site early due to rareassessment errors or low individual-thresholds, and the remaindercontinuing to re-assess the same site until they eventually decide itis good enough. When a second higher quality site is introduced,the same small proportion of ants will accept the poor site earlydue to low-threshold or assessment error, but the remainder willnow tend to discover the alternative, superior site, and recruitto this quickly on average because of its increased quality. Thesame pattern would be observed for a threshold-rule with directcomparison (see Text S1), and also for a quality-dependent re-cruitment latency-rule, if it is assumed that ants search foralternatives during the latency period and have a high probabilityof finding other sites [20]. However, these alternative models areless parsimonious, requiring ants to remember the qualities and/orlocations of visited sites and evaluate this in making subsequentcomparisons or use the information to decide when and where tostart recruiting. These results also clearly demonstrate that aphenomenon observed when only one option is available, cannotbe assumed to function in the same way when choosing betweenmultiple options (see also [7]).Another well-studied example of collective decision-making isnest-site choice by swarming honeybees (Apis mellifera). Like antcolonies, bee swarms are able to choose between different nestsites, and individual bees do not need to have visited multiple sitesfor the swarm to be able to choose between them [40]. However,the way the scouts act on this information differs between the twogroups. The ants seem to use a binary decision process to eitheraccept that nest or continue searching. Ants accepting a nestrecruit others, causing a positive feedback process, but ant scoutsdo not modulate their recruitment according to nest quality, e.g.by recruiting at a faster rate or for longer to a higher quality nest[20,26]. In contrast, bees use a graded process, whereby scoutsinitially discovering a new nest-site almost always recruit [41],but the duration and rate of the recruiting waggle-dances aredependent on nest quality [42]. This means that more recruits arebrought to better nest-sites, leading to a positive feedback processusually resulting in a unanimous choice of the better site [42]. Onepossible reason for this difference in strategy could be differencesin nest availability: if suitable honeybee nest sites are relativelyrare, then it might be better for scouts to avoid ever rejecting apotential nest outright.Collective decisions are also made in other contexts, such aschoice of foraging site. Here again, comparisons of sites by indi-viduals seems to play little role. Foraging honeybees do not com-pare food sources [43], nor do they compare the waggle-dances ofrecruiters at the hive [44]. Rather, multiple sites ‘compete’ forforagers, with bees foraging more persistently at high quality sitesand recruiting to them more energetically [43,45]. Foragers canalso directly inhibit recruitment if they perceive danger at a par-ticular food source by the use of ‘stop-signals’ directed at beesrecruiting to that source [46]. In trail-laying ants and bees,pheromone trails to better foraging sites are more stronglyreinforced and this again leads to a collective choice without anynecessity for individuals to visit multiple sites [47,48]. Just as fornest-site choice, foraging recruitment can either be graded (layingmore pheromone to a better food source, e.g. [47,49]) or a binarydecision (all-or-nothing recruitment, e.g. [50,51]).Direct comparison of alternatives is seen in a range of animalsand contexts, including foraging in scrub jays and humans [8,52],mate choice in bower-birds and dance-flies [53,54] and shellassessment by hermit crabs [55]. A best-of-n comparison strategywould maximise decision accuracy [2], so why do neither indi-vidual bees nor ants appear to use this strategy when foraging orchoosing a new home? One possibility is that multiple comparisonsare too cognitively complex for ant and bee brains. However,small insects including bees are competent at related cognitiveprocesses, including contextual learning, discrimination betweenstimuli and associative recall [56]. Male dance-flies compare thesize of potential mates before choosing [54], and there is evidenceto suggest that honeybee workers are capable of comparativeevaluation of flowers [57] and that lone T. rugatulus ant workers arecapable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are veryclose together [25]. There may, therefore, be reasons other thancognitive constraints for why relying on individual best-of-ncomparisons to inform collective choices does not appear to haveevolved as a decision mechanism in bees or ants. One possiblereason is that during their evolutionary history the ants havetypically been faced with decisions about whether to accept asingle option at a time, rather than simultaneously having in-formation about multiple options, and this has shaped theevolution of their decision process [7]. Another possible reason isthe potential speed advantage of avoiding a sampling period.Sampling periods can be costly [2,7] and pose the mathematicallycomplex problem of deciding how long to sample for beforestarting the decision process [58]. Avoiding best-of-n comparisonsallows a potentially vulnerable colony to select the first nestencountered, if it is good enough. Perhaps even more important isdistributing the decision-making process, relying less on informa-tion-processing by a single individual; rather allowing the decisionA Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981to emerge from a collective process to which even partly-informedindividuals can contribute. In this colony-level cognition, therelevant information about the environment is represented withinthe individuals in a colony, their actions and interactions. At thecollective level this generates new information: which nest thecolony should choose [59]. In both bees and ants, the informationheld by individuals is integrated into a colony choice by means of aquorum threshold, which triggers rapid implementation of thedecision [18,60]. Although the colony will usually choose the sitewhich reaches quorum first, this does not mean that the colony asa whole must ‘satisfice’, accepting the first nest surpassing someminimum standard. Using quality-dependent initiation (in Tem-nothorax ants) or modulation (in honeybees) of the recruitmentprocess leading to the attainment of a quorum, the colony in effectcarries out a concurrent but indirect collective comparison process,which may implement optimal decision-making through theactions of partly-informed individuals [61]. This ensures that thenest to reach a quorum first is also likely to be the best option, evenwhen there is an array of possible alternatives [16,42]. Thuswithout the individuals using a ‘best-of-n’ comparison strategy, thecolony is able to solve a ‘best-of-n’ challenge [16,62].A further possible advantage of avoiding individual directcomparisons is that it would remove the risk of ‘irrational’ decisionbehaviour at the individual level [26], associated with comparative,relative evaluation of options such as best-of-n, or sequentialcomparisons. Individuals following our proposed threshold rulemake an absolute evaluation of quality, and this evaluation of oneoption is not influenced by the other alternatives available, incontrast to the context-dependent decision-making used by manyother animals including humans [8,63,64]. Although at thecollective level, a comparison between options is effectively beingmade, a non-comparative individual-level mechanism for thisdecision could protect the colony from irrationality in decision-making. For example, emigrating T. albipennis colonies followrational transitivity patterns in decision making [16] and in therelated species T. curvispinosus and T. rugatulus, colonies seem to beimmune to irrational distractor effects from irrelevant alternatives[25,65]. Although work on T. rugatulus suggests that this collectiveimmunity can emerge even if individuals are susceptible todistractor effects provided their individual contribution to thecollective decision is small [25], our work suggests this collectiverationality can emerge without depending on low numbers of antsvisiting both nests – if individual ants follow the threshold rule, thenthe colony can escape these irrational comparison behaviours.Using an absolute evaluation method does have a potentialdrawback, if the acceptance threshold is not appropriate to theenvironment. When used in individual decision making (e.g.during mate choice in cockroaches, [9]) the success of this sort ofsequential search strategy will be highly sensitive to the thresholdused. For example, if all available options are poor quality, ananimal may reject them all, and end up worse off than if it hadaccepted a poor option. In contrast, when this strategy is used forgroup decision making, variation in acceptance thresholds acrossthe group provides protection against this sensitivity. If all optionsare poor quality, some low-threshold individuals will still acceptone, allowing the group to make a choice. Similarly, intra-colonyvariation in task response thresholds promotes effective division oflabour in social insect colonies, with more individuals engaging ina particular task when the stimulus for that task increases [66–68].Our model assumes that individual thresholds are fixed over thetime-scale of the emigration process, however further flexibilitywould be available if acceptance thresholds were updated based onexperience over the course of an individual’s life-time [69,70].Flexible task thresholds promote flexible division of labour in socialinsect colonies [71–73]. How much acceptance threshold variationactually occurs within a colony, and whether ant acceptancethresholds are fixed throughout life or changed by experience, areissues remaining to be explored.In summary, our simple individual-threshold model is sufficientto explain empirical decision-making data, without assuming morecomplex behavioural mechanisms. Since the scientific methodgives preference to the more parsimonious model, this result showsthat care is needed in inferring individual behaviour from groupbehaviour. We propose that, in general, individual decision-makers can use this simple threshold rule to provide their groupwith an elegant solution to the problem of making a collectivechoice. This strategy allows the group to make a rational, well-informed and rapid decision.Supporting InformationFigure S1 ‘Expected decision time in a two-nest scenario.Expected time for an ant to accept any site across varying qualities(probabilities of acceptance) of sites A and B, calculated fromequation 2.(TIF)Figure S2 ‘Expected decision time in one-nest scenario.Expected time for an ant to accept any site, using the parametersof Figure 6, for the no-comparison threshold-rule of the main text(red), and for the direct-comparison threshold-rule describedabove (green).(TIF)Text S1 This supplementary model information coversdetails of model parameterisation for the analytical andsimulation modelling.

An alternative possible decision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simple rule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can account parsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when available nests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. We present empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individual sequential comparisons are not ruled out.

The fitness benefits of choosing the best option mean thatdecision-making strategies will be subject to natural selection. Mul-tiple comparison or ‘best of n’ strategies perform most accurately,and are likely to be optimal when searching and sampling costs arelow, e.g. on a lek [1,2] and when long-term fitness implications ofthe decision are high, e.g. in home range selection [3]. In othersituations, e.g. during foraging, there can be substantial time coststo making accurate decisions [4,5], and these costs can be so greatas to make quicker less accurate decisions more efficient [6]. Ani-mals may be best served by using a simpler ‘rule of thumb’, whichreduces sampling time, but still ensures the option they choose isgood enough. One simple but effective strategy is sequential searchin which the animal keeps searching until it finds an option thatexceeds a threshold of acceptability [2,7]. This kind of fixed-threshold strategy is used in foraging [8], mate choice [9] andrefuge selection [10]. An intermediate strategy is to allow thresh-olds to be influenced by experience of previous options; in effectthis would cause a ‘sequential comparison’.Social animals make collective decisions between availableoptions, particularly about where the group spends its time. Whenmaking a shared collective decision, a group faces the challenges ofintegrating information from multiple individuals and managingthe different decision-preferences of group members [11]. Suchdecisions are influenced by individual information, conflicts ofinterest and time-constraints [12,13]. To understand how a col-lective decision is reached, the rules followed by contributingmembers of the group must be identified [14]. Emigrating socialinsects are a good model system for the study of collective decision-making, because all members share the aim of coming to a con-sensus about a new, good nest site as soon as possible, but theinformation about available site quality is distributed very un-evenly within the colony [15,16]. To investigate the mechanismof decision making, we used models of, and experiments on,emigrating cavity-nesting rock ants, Temnothorax albipennis.A colony emigration by rock ants begins with scouts searchingfor and assessing new sites. Successful scouts recruit nest-matesusing tandem running, in which an informed ant leads another tothe new site [17]. When the number of ants at a site reaches a‘quorum threshold’, the ants switch to rapid transport behaviour tocarry the brood, queen and remaining nest-mates to the new nest[18]. Ant colonies discriminate between nest sites on the basis of arange of attributes including cavity dimensions, light level andentrance width [16,19]. Three possible mechanisms by which thecolony collectively chooses the better of two nests have beenproposed: i) comparison ii) recruitment latency iii) threshold rule.PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981First, ants could use a comparison strategy, in which ants that havevisited both nests would compare their qualities and recruit nest-mates only to the better one [20]. Second, ants visiting just onenest could determine how long they hesitate before recruiting nest-mates (recruitment latency) based on the nest quality [20]. Acombination of these two mechanisms has been used as the basis ofseveral decision models [18,21–24]. Although lone T. rugatulus antworkers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites whichare very close together [25], the evidence for individual antsmaking direct comparisons between nests during colony emigra-tion is weak [26], and furthermore, ant colonies are able to choosea distant good nest over a nearby poor nest, when recruitmentlatency differences would be expected to be cancelled out by traveltime (Fig. 1a) [26,27]. The third possible mechanism of choice is asequential search strategy, based on a very simple rule of thumb, a‘threshold rule’, by which an ant assesses a nest against her ownfixed quality threshold, and either accepts the nest and beginsrecruitment, or rejects it and continues searching [26]. Quality-dependent recruitment latency has been demonstrated empiricallyonly when colonies were presented with a single new nest and werenot required to make a choice [20,22,24,28]. Robinson et al. [26]hypothesized that these apparent recruitment latency effects couldemerge as a by-product of a threshold rule, because ants that finda low-quality nest will tend to reject it and continue searching,whereas ants that find a high quality nest will tend to accept it andbegin recruitment. In addition, Robinson et al. [26] hypothesizedthat the apparent comparison phenomenon in which ants thathave visited equidistant poor and good nests usually recruit only tothe good nest (Fig. 1b; [20]) can be explained more parsimoniouslywith a threshold rule in which the poor nest is rejected and for-gotten, then the good nest is discovered and accepted, rather thanrequiring individual ants to perform the more cognitively complextask of remembering and comparing the qualities of different nests.We aim to test the hypothesis that this simple parsimoniousmechanism (the threshold rule) is sufficient to reproduce observedempirical patterns of collective decision-making.Here we present a Markov-chain model of decision-making,based on a simple threshold rule. Our model ants search for nests,and compare those they find to an internal acceptance threshold,subject to assessment error. This model includes no memory ofprevious nests, and no ability to make direct comparisons betweenthe nests an ant has encountered. It also includes no explicitquality-dependent recruitment latency. We compare the results ofthis model to empirical results from two published studies and onenew experiment, to test whether our model can produce thequalitative patterns seen in the empirical data. By parameterizingour model as far as possible to previous experiments [20,26] wetest whether this simple threshold-rule is sufficient to explainapparent recruitment latency and comparison effects. We also usethe model to predict emigration behaviour in a new experimentthat presents an ant colony with three equidistant nests, one goodand two poor (Fig. 1c). We performed this experiment usingindividually radio-tagged ants to monitor individual-level behav-iour and compare our empirical results to the model predictions.We thus test whether a very simple individual-level ‘rule of thumb’is sufficient to explain sophisticated collective decision-making.MethodsModelTo investigate the proposed threshold rule, we present a verysimple model. As we are only concerned with independent dis-covery by scouts before recruitment commences, we examine thecolony’s decision process analytically and using Monte-Carlo sim-ulation, modelling ants as independent instantiations of a Markovprocess. Ants independently accept sites according to a probabilityspecified by the site’s quality and their individual threshold, other-wise they search randomly for a site to assess (Fig. 2). We havemodelled a discontinuous acceptance function here, but this couldbe relaxed to be a smooth (e.g. sigmoidal) function of differencebetween internal threshold and sampled quality, without qualita-tively affecting the results. The Markov process has five states:‘assessing home site’, ‘assessing poor site’, ‘assessing good site’,‘committed to poor site’, and ‘committed to good site’. Allindividuals start in the ‘assessing home site’ state but the home siteis considered uninhabitable in the model, and its quality is set toFigure 1. Arenas used in emigration experiments, showing nestlocations. Dashed outline= old destroyed nest; shading= good nests.(A) Good nest 120 cm from old nest; poor nest 30 cm [26].

A simulated ant continues searchinguntil it encounters a nest of a quality (b) exceeding the ant’s individualthreshold (a), taking into account assessment error (e). Ants may revisitthe same nest (with probability r), and do not have any memory ofpreviously visited nests.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019981.g002A Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981negative infinity, therefore an ant can never become committed toit. Ants can switch between the assessment states, but we assumethat once committed to a site an ant remains so and recruits nest-mates to its preferred option; the recruitment process is not mod-elled, and the ‘committed’ states are therefore absorbing states.For the Monte-Carlo simulations, we model nest quality accep-tance thresholds in the colony as a normally distributed randomvariable A, with some mean and variance. An individual simulatedant has a quality acceptance threshold a drawn at random fromthis distribution. It discovers its next nest by sampling from aprobability distribution specified by its current nest, arena size andshape, and the proximities of other available nest sites (Table 1);part of this distribution is determined by the probability r that arandomly searching scout rediscovers the site it has just been in.On discovering a site, the scout evaluates the quality of the currentnest site with some error e added, sampled from a standard normaldistribution (mean 0; standard deviation 1); this corresponds toerror in the scout’s quality assessment. If this sampled qualityexceeds the scout’s acceptance threshold then it becomes com-mitted to the site, otherwise it continues searching (Fig. 2). Accep-tance threshold distributions and nest qualities are given arbitraryvalues (Table 1), because individual probabilities of becomingcommitted to a nest are hard to estimate empirically, due to thedifficulties in accurately identifying commitment and in eliminat-ing the effects of interactions between ants. In the model, traveltimes between sites are sampled from normal distributions. Byparameterizing this model to empirical ant movement speed andspecific experimental arenas (Table 1), we can approximate theexpected time for each simulated ant to find each nest, and thetime from first finding a nest to becoming committed to it (the antmay visit other nests in between, or visit the same nest many timesbefore committing to it). This allows us to calculate recruitmentlatencies for comparison with empirical data. In the empiricalstudies, recruitment latency concerns the time from discovering anest to first recruiting to that nest. We do not include recruitmentin the model, so modelled recruitment latency concerns the timefrom discovering a nest to ‘accepting’ that nest. For real antcolonies, searching behaviour is much reduced when quorum isachieved; we truncate the simulated data at the time at whichquorum was achieved in the real experiment, to increase com-parability (see Text S1).Model Analysis. In addition to the simulation model de-scribed in this paper, we can derive analytic results for the pro-posed rule for switching between nests. To facilitate this analysiswe simplify the Markov process slightly from that used in theMonte-Carlo simulations, by discarding the state of assessing thehome site. The four states in the simplified Markov process arethus ‘assessing poor site’, ‘assessing good site’, ‘committed to poorsite’, and ‘committed to good site’, and the state transition matrixis (with states ordered as described above from top to bottom andfrom left to right)Q~(1{p)r (1{g)(1{r) 0 0(1{p)(1{r) (1{g)r 0 0p 0 1 00 g 0 10BBB@1CCCA, ð1Þwhere p is the average per-visit probability that an ant accepts thepoor site, g is the average per-visit probability that an ant acceptsthe good site, and r is the probability that a randomly searchingscout rediscovers the site it has just been in.

The probability distribution over theinitial states (‘assessing poor site’ and ‘assessing good site’) can bederived based on the relative probabilities of an arbitrary ant scoutdiscovering either when searching from the home site.Using standard techniques [e.g. 29] we derive analytic results onthe long-run behaviour of the threshold-switching rule, using thestate transition matrix Q (eq. 1) and its fundamental matrix. Ofparticular relevance to our proposals is the analysis of the expectedtime for the Markov-process to reach any absorbing state, whenstarted in some particular non-absorbing state. If we assume bothcandidate nest sites are equally likely to be discovered first from thehome site, then the expected number of steps in the Markov-chainbefore commitment to either nest site is reached is given byE(time to accept any site)~4(1{r)z2r(pzg){p{g2((2r{1)pgz(1{r)(pzg)): ð2ÞEquation (2) will be used below to examine the sensitivity ofacceptance time to changes in site qualities. Note that, technically,we should be interested in the latency between discovering aparticular site, and recruiting to that site, however in general per-state latencies are difficult to calculate in Markov-chains, and theoverall expected latency given in equation 2 is an acceptable sim-plification (see Text S1).Empirical methodsEthics statement. Our experiments on T. albipennis andcollection of colonies from the field comply with the laws of thecountry in which they were carried out and the relevant nationaland international guidelines [30,31].‘Three-New-Nests’ Experiment. Six T. albipennis colonieswere collected from the Dorset coast, England, June–July 2009.Colonies were queenright and contained 80–200 workers andbrood of all stages. Colonies were housed in artificial nests [27]and provided with water ad libitum and honey solution andDrosophila melanogaster weekly. We used these colonies to investigatedecision-making when a colony was offered a choice of three newnests. Six trials were performed, each with a new colony. One dayprior to an emigration trial, we attached an RFID micro-transponder (50065006120 mm) with a unique ID to the thoraxof every worker ant in the colony [32,33] and housed the colony ina nest formed of a hexagonal glass slide (edge length = 30 mm), a1.5 mm cardboard perimeter (cavity area 1496 mm2) and anacetate lid with a central entrance hole (1.5 mm diameter) to avoidintroducing directional bias. We performed trials in a circulararena with Fluon-coated sides, the floor of which was cleaned withwater and alcohol between trials. Three new hexagonal nests withthe same dimensions as the original nest were placed in the arena(Fig. 1c). Two nests had clear acetate lids and one had a red filtercovering the cavity area, making the nest appear relatively dark tothe ants [34]. Ant colonies choose dark over light nests [19]. Theposition of the good nest was interchanged between trials. Thenew nests had 1.5 mm wide entrances in the side facing the centreof the arena, over which RFID readers (PharmaSeq, Inc., NJ) wereplaced vertically. A trial began with the original nest placed in thecentre of the arena and then destroyed by removing the lid. TheRFID readers detected ants entering and leaving the new nests[86% tag read rate, 26] and we used handheld RFID readers toread the tags on tandem-running ants (94% tag read rate) as theycrossed half-way lines (Fig. 1c). The identity of the leader andfollower was thus recorded and the direction of the tandem runwas noted. This procedure does not disrupt tandem runs [26]. Thetime at which the transport by carrying of a nest-mate or a brooditem first occurred to each nest was recorded (i.e. the time at whichthe quorum threshold was reached). Once nest-mate transport hascommenced, the RFID system becomes less reliable [26], becausenest-mates are transported in such a way as to block the RFID tag.We therefore focused our analysis on searching and recruitment bytandem-running during the pre-quorum period. We observedemigrations until complete (old nest empty of brood and workers)and recorded the nest choice of the colony after 24 hours. Colo-nies were considered to have split if brood was present in two ormore nests.Statistical MethodsMean recruitment latencies were analysed using generalisedlinear mixed models (GLMM) ‘glmmPQL’ in the MASS library inR 2.4.1 with nest quality as a fixed factor, colony (empirical results)or replicate (simulation results) as a random factor and a Poissonerror structure. Differences between recruitment latency survivor-ship curves, were tested using generalized log-rank tests using thefunction ‘survdiff’ in the survival library in R 2.4.1. Monte Carlosimulations were carried out using MatLab 7.4.0 (see Text S1),and matrix manipulation with Maple 14.ResultsComparison with Poor Nest Near; Good Nest Far DataWe parameterized the model to the experimental set-up used byRobinson et al. [26] with a nearby poor nest and a more distantgood nest (Table 1, Fig. 1a) and performed Monte Carlo simu-lations of this experiment. The switching behaviour (ants movingfrom visiting one nest to visiting the other) in the simulations isqualitatively very similar to the empirical data (Fig. 3). In bothcases most ants that find the far (good) nest first stay at that nest,whereas ants that find the near (poor) nest first may stay or switch.The model simulations also reproduce the empirical results thatrecruitment latency does not play an important role here. In theempirical study, recruitment latency was measured as time fromdiscovering a nest to first leading a tandem run to that nest anddata are only available for ants which recruited by tandem-running. There are more recruitment latencies for the simulateddata, as all ants make a choice in the model, whereas in the realdata not all active ants perform tandem runs. This leads toquantitative differences between simulated and empirical data, butqualitatively the patterns are the same: In the simulated data, as inthe empirical data, there are no significant differences betweenrecruitment latencies to the good and poor nests (Fig. 4a, 4b).However, in a simulation presenting the two nests separately (i.e.either only old nest and near poor nest are present, or only old nestand far good nest are present) the pattern is dramatically different,with significantly higher recruitment latencies for the poor nest(Fig. 4c). This clearly demonstrates that differences in recruitmentlatency can be generated when only one nest is present, as a side-effect of the threshold rule.Comparison with Two-Equidistant-Nests DataTo test whether our model can account for the patterns seen inthe original experiments, used as evidence for the recruitmentlatency and comparison mechanisms [20], we also parameterisedthe Monte Carlo model to this experimental set-up (Fig. 1b,Table 1). Here two equidistant new nests, one good and one poor,are presented to the ant colony. The empirical data for directcomparison are shown in Table 2. Very similar results emerge inour simulations, without any memory or comparison coded intothe model (Table 2), clearly showing that this sort of behaviouralpattern can be accounted for by the threshold rule alone, withoutA Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981needing to include other mechanisms. However, the exact quan-titative results of our simulations are influenced by the acceptancethreshold and nest quality parameters. Since we do not know theshape of the real threshold distribution in an ant colony, the matchbetween simulated and empirical data here does not prove thatcomparison plays no role in ant decision-making, but does showthat results of this type do not necessarily have to be the producedby comparative evaluation.In the empirical data (Fig. 5a–f), there do appear to be quality-dependent differences in recruitment latency – however, the nestswere presented separately in these experiments. Recruitmentlatency is measured using survival analysis, treating ants that find asite but never recruit to it as censored data. Applying the sameanalysis to our simulated results demonstrates that we can repli-cate these differences in recruitment latency when the nests arepresented separately (Fig. 5g–l) but the differences disappear whenthe simulations are repeated identically, but with the nestspresented together (Fig. 5m–r). This is same pattern as wasobserved in the comparison with the the ‘poor nest near; good nestfar’ data, even though recruitment latencies are measureddifferently in the two empirical studies. These simulation resultsdemonstrate that the observed empirical differences in recruitmentFigure 3. Comparison of empirical and simulated emigration behavior. Number of ants continuing to visit the same nest (stay) or going onto visit the other nest (switch), depends on the quality of the first nest visited. (A) Empirical results, 9 colonies, mean + SD.

We consider the two site case first; todo this we shall hold one of the nest site qualities constant whilevarying the other nest site quality, and examine the effect on theexpected time to reach commitment to either site. Figure 6illustrates how expected decision time varies for the one and twosite cases, for a given revisiting value of r (0.7, estimated fromempirical data). We vary the quality of the poor site (A) whilekeeping the quality of the good site (B) constant, holding g constantwhile varying p in the interval [0, 1] (see eq. 2). For a moderatequality of the constant nest (P(accept B) = g=0.88, estimated fromempirical data) expected decision time varies little between theextremes of the other nest’s quality (P(accept A) = p=0 to 1), thuswhen two nest sites are present, strong quality dependent recruit-ment latency is not evident (Fig. 6, solid line). This contrastsmarkedly with the situation where there is only one potential nestsite; this is equivalent to setting p= g in equation 2. Now a muchmore pronounced relationship between the quality of this site, andthe expected time until commitment, is evident (Fig. 6, dashedline). These analytic results agree qualitatively with results fromthe Monte-Carlo simulation (Fig. 5). This is good evidence forthe threshold rule, but does not in itself rule out sequential com-parisons since a version of the model with sequential comparisonsgives almost indistinguishable results (see Text S1, Fig. S2). How-ever, the sequential comparison model makes greater cognitivedemands on individuals, who must remember the qualities ofvisited sites and evaluate this in making subsequent comparisons.Three-New-Nests: Simulation Predictions and EmpiricalDataA total of 752 ants (across 6 colonies) were individually radio-tagged and their scouting activity was monitored during emi-gration experiments in which each colony chose between onegood and two poor nests (Fig. 1c). According to the thresholdrule, ants which independently (i.e. not by following a tandemrun) visit the good nest (A) and one of the poor nests (designatedB) and then visited another nest before quorum was reached (atwhich point carrying behaviour begins), should be equally likelyto return to good nest A or discover the other, equidistant, poornest (designated C). In contrast, if ants are using best-of-n directcomparisons, ants which have visited good nest A and then nest Bshould be more likely to return to A than to discover C.In the empirical data, 20 individuals out of the 752 wemonitored fulfilled the necessary behavioural criteria of finding Aand then B before quorum was reached. This sample size is smallbecause this behaviour was fairly rare – as would be predicted byour model, ants finding A tended to start recruiting, rather thandiscover B. Using this sample size of 20 ants for 100 simulationreplicates gives 95% confidence intervals of 7–12 ants returning toA; 8–13 ants discovering C. The empirical data fit well withinthese limits, with 11 ants returning to A and 9 discovering C. Thisdoes not differ significantly from random choice (binomial test,P=0.82). This supports the threshold hypothesis and shows noevidence that ants act on information from comparison of nests toallow them to preferentially return to a better nest.Although our data show that ants did not preferentially returnto the good nest, the comparison hypothesis could still be sup-ported if those that did return to it did so more directly becausethey had remembered its high quality. This is not the case: antsmade 0–27 (median= 3) repeat visits to B before returning to A,compared to 0–6 (median= 0) visits to B before discovering C(Mann-Whitney test: U=73, N=20, P=0.07). The trend is in theopposite direction to that predicted by the hypothesis that antsmake a comparison and act on it to return more directly to betternests. These data are consistent with threshold-based choice.A second test of whether individual ants are comparing nestsinvolves decisions to recruit nest-mates by leading a tandem-runto the new nest. If ants are using a ‘best-of-n’ comparison strategy,the sampling period before recruiting should be independent ofthe quality of the first nest they visit, whereas if ants use aninternal threshold rule, the number of nests they sample beforerecruiting should be strongly dependent on the quality of the firstnest they visit, with ants that find the high quality nest first beinglikely to initiate recruitment to this nest immediately. In theempirical data, 13 individual ants initiated recruitment by leadinga tandem run, of which 8 had discovered the good nest first, and 5had discovered a poor nest first. Using these sample sizes for 100simulation replicates predicts that ants finding the good nest firstshould not visit any other nest before recruiting (median totalnests visited: 95%CI 1-1) whereas ants finding the poor nest firstshould be more likely to visit other nests before recruiting (mediantotal nests visited 95%CI 1-2). The empirical data fit thesepredictions. Ants which found the good nest first visited a medianof only that 1 nest before recruiting, whereas those which foundthe poor nest visited a median of 2 different nests before leading atandem run (Mann-Whitney test, U=36, N=13, P,0.05). Thedata do not support the recruitment latency mechanism, as thereare no quality-dependent differences in time from nest discov-ery to recruitment by tandem-running (good nest: mean 6SD= 20619 min; poor nest: mean 6 SD=28624 min; t-test:t12=0.71, P=0.49).DiscussionOur results show that a very simple individual mechanism canproduce effective collective decision-making. The predictions ofour threshold decision-making model correspond well withempirical data from house-hunting ants. Our simulations of theTable 2.

This explanationof empirical data is supported by our analytical modelling results.Our results clearly support the hypothesis that this simple par-simonious mechanism (the threshold rule) is sufficient to reproduceobserved empirical patterns of collective decision-making: ourresults can account for both apparent direct comparison of nestquality and for apparent quality-dependent recruitment latency,which had been previously proposed as mechanisms of collectivechoice. Our parsimonious threshold model is sufficient to explainthe data without assuming more complex behavioural mecha-nisms. This highlights the need for carefully designed experimentsto determine whether or not individuals make comparisons, anddemonstrates that group-level comparison behaviour does notnecessarily imply individual-level comparison behaviour. In thecase of ants, evidence of the ability of lone individuals to makedirect comparisons of alternatives has only recently been published[25]; as our results show, previously published studies were notsufficient to demonstrate this. Further empirical investigation isrequired to establish what role, if any, direct comparison by in-dividual ants plays in the collective decision-process.We can subdivide comparison behaviour into two types thatcan aid decision-making: best-of-n comparisons and sequentialcomparisons. Best-of-n comparison mechanisms are characterisedby a sampling period, and preferential return to the best option[35]. We conducted a multiple-nest experiment to test directly ifreal ants show these behaviours. Neither is observed. In contrast,the results support the threshold model: if the first nest theyencountered was of a high quality, the ants started recruitmentimmediately without continuing to sample, and those ants whichhad the opportunity to compare nests did not act on this infor-mation by preferential or more direct return to better nests.Sequential comparisons occur when each time an animal en-counters a new option, it compares the new option to its memoryof previously encountered options and is more likely to accept thenew one if it compares favourably. This is similar to the thresholdmodel, but thresholds are influenced by experience. In one variantof this, individuals sample several options and then accept the nextoption they encounter which exceeds the quality of all previousoptions. This strategy can be shown to provide the optimalsolution to the ‘secretary problem’; a sequential search problem inwhich previously encountered options are subsequently unavail-able [36]. We modelled a sequential comparison mechanism (seeText S1) to compare with our threshold model. The results showthat this type of comparison model predicts similar recruitmentlatency results to our threshold model. We therefore cannot ruleout this sequential comparison mechanism, but note that it is a lessparsimonious solution. Our threshold model is sufficient to explainthe data without invoking memory and comparison during thedecision process.Our simulated ants have no memory of previously visited nests,and yet behaviour previously described as ‘comparison’ stillemerges in our simulations (Table 2). This clearly shows thatempirical data of this sort cannot be used as evidence that ananimal is really remembering and comparing. The decisionprocess we propose is ‘memoryless’ in the sense that individualants do not have to remember previously visited alternativesduring their search for an acceptable nest. Our model deals onlywith the decision process up to the point at which an ant accepts anest. After that point, real ants clearly do use memory of nestlocation in order to recruit nest-mates to that nest by tandem-running [20]. Recruitment is the most easily identifiable actionindicating commitment, but ants that have accepted a nest mayalso act on their commitment by making repeat visits to the nest[26,37]. By making repeat visits, ants are able to assess nest areamore accurately [37] and would also contribute to the accumu-lation of a quorum at their chosen nest, causing the switch to rapidnest-mate carrying behaviour [18]. Memory is therefore animportant part of the implementation of the decision, but antsfollowing the threshold rule do not need to invest in rememberingthe qualities or locations of multiple nests during the decision-making process.Figure 6. Analytical results of Markov Chain model. Expectedtime for an ant to accept any site across varying qualities of site A,calculated from equation 2. Dashed line: only site A present. Solid line:two nests present; site B fixed at P(accept nest B) = 0.88 (estimated fromdata, see Text S1, Fig. S1). For two nests present, either site is equallylikely to be discovered first. Nest rediscovery probability r= 0.7(estimated from data, see Text S1, Table S1). The reduced effect ofsite A’s quality on expected decision time is robust to variations in siteB’s quality, except where this becomes low (see Fig. S1).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019981.g006Figure 5.

The initial advantage is amplified by recruitment, and thiscan be shown to be sufficient to account for collective choice [24].In both the threshold rule and the recruitment latency hypothesis,a scout makes a probabilistic, quality-dependent decision aboutwhether to recruit each time she visits a nest. The differencebetween these mechanisms come from the assumptions madeabout what the scout does after leaving the nest, and how thisresults in a colony decision-mechanism. In our threshold rule, theant either commits or continues searching. In the recruitmentlatency hypothesis, ants which do not immediately start recruitingmay subsequently recruit, with a quality-dependent latency. In theoriginal formulation of this idea [20] it is mentioned that antsmight discover other nests during this latent period, but it is notsuggested that the latency is actually a result of the search for othernests. Searching for alternatives has a more prominent role in laterversions of the recruitment latency model [24] making it moresimilar to our threshold model, however, the idea of simplequality-dependent recruitment latencies functioning as a choicemechanism still appears often in discussions of collective decision-making [11,38,39]. There are two empirical problems with such amechanism. Firstly, colonies are able to choose a good nest, evenwhen it is so much further away than a poor nest that travel timeshould cancel out differences in recruitment latency [27]. Sec-ondly, all empirical evidence for quality-dependent recruitmentlatencies comes from studies offering a colony just one new nest[20,22,24,28]. When recruitment latencies are measured inmultiple nest experiments, no quality-dependent recruitmentlatencies differences are observed [this study and 26]. We usedmodelling to investigate these empirical results. Our simulationand analytical results reproduce quality-dependent recruitmentlatency in a single-nest experiment, but show that the presence ofan extra nest disrupts the quality-dependence of the latency tocommitment and recruitment (Figs. 5–6). When a single poor nestis offered, acceptance times in the model will be geometricallydistributed, with few ants accepting the site early due to rareassessment errors or low individual-thresholds, and the remaindercontinuing to re-assess the same site until they eventually decide itis good enough. When a second higher quality site is introduced,the same small proportion of ants will accept the poor site earlydue to low-threshold or assessment error, but the remainder willnow tend to discover the alternative, superior site, and recruitto this quickly on average because of its increased quality. Thesame pattern would be observed for a threshold-rule with directcomparison (see Text S1), and also for a quality-dependent re-cruitment latency-rule, if it is assumed that ants search foralternatives during the latency period and have a high probabilityof finding other sites [20]. However, these alternative models areless parsimonious, requiring ants to remember the qualities and/orlocations of visited sites and evaluate this in making subsequentcomparisons or use the information to decide when and where tostart recruiting. These results also clearly demonstrate that aphenomenon observed when only one option is available, cannotbe assumed to function in the same way when choosing betweenmultiple options (see also [7]).Another well-studied example of collective decision-making isnest-site choice by swarming honeybees (Apis mellifera). Like antcolonies, bee swarms are able to choose between different nestsites, and individual bees do not need to have visited multiple sitesfor the swarm to be able to choose between them [40]. However,the way the scouts act on this information differs between the twogroups. The ants seem to use a binary decision process to eitheraccept that nest or continue searching. Ants accepting a nestrecruit others, causing a positive feedback process, but ant scoutsdo not modulate their recruitment according to nest quality, e.g.by recruiting at a faster rate or for longer to a higher quality nest[20,26]. In contrast, bees use a graded process, whereby scoutsinitially discovering a new nest-site almost always recruit [41],but the duration and rate of the recruiting waggle-dances aredependent on nest quality [42]. This means that more recruits arebrought to better nest-sites, leading to a positive feedback processusually resulting in a unanimous choice of the better site [42]. Onepossible reason for this difference in strategy could be differencesin nest availability: if suitable honeybee nest sites are relativelyrare, then it might be better for scouts to avoid ever rejecting apotential nest outright.Collective decisions are also made in other contexts, such aschoice of foraging site. Here again, comparisons of sites by indi-viduals seems to play little role. Foraging honeybees do not com-pare food sources [43], nor do they compare the waggle-dances ofrecruiters at the hive [44]. Rather, multiple sites ‘compete’ forforagers, with bees foraging more persistently at high quality sitesand recruiting to them more energetically [43,45]. Foragers canalso directly inhibit recruitment if they perceive danger at a par-ticular food source by the use of ‘stop-signals’ directed at beesrecruiting to that source [46]. In trail-laying ants and bees,pheromone trails to better foraging sites are more stronglyreinforced and this again leads to a collective choice without anynecessity for individuals to visit multiple sites [47,48]. Just as fornest-site choice, foraging recruitment can either be graded (layingmore pheromone to a better food source, e.g. [47,49]) or a binarydecision (all-or-nothing recruitment, e.g. [50,51]).Direct comparison of alternatives is seen in a range of animalsand contexts, including foraging in scrub jays and humans [8,52],mate choice in bower-birds and dance-flies [53,54] and shellassessment by hermit crabs [55]. A best-of-n comparison strategywould maximise decision accuracy [2], so why do neither indi-vidual bees nor ants appear to use this strategy when foraging orchoosing a new home? One possibility is that multiple comparisonsare too cognitively complex for ant and bee brains. However,small insects including bees are competent at related cognitiveprocesses, including contextual learning, discrimination betweenstimuli and associative recall [56]. Male dance-flies compare thesize of potential mates before choosing [54], and there is evidenceto suggest that honeybee workers are capable of comparativeevaluation of flowers [57] and that lone T. rugatulus ant workers arecapable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are veryclose together [25]. There may, therefore, be reasons other thancognitive constraints for why relying on individual best-of-ncomparisons to inform collective choices does not appear to haveevolved as a decision mechanism in bees or ants. One possiblereason is that during their evolutionary history the ants havetypically been faced with decisions about whether to accept asingle option at a time, rather than simultaneously having in-formation about multiple options, and this has shaped theevolution of their decision process [7]. Another possible reason isthe potential speed advantage of avoiding a sampling period.Sampling periods can be costly [2,7] and pose the mathematicallycomplex problem of deciding how long to sample for beforestarting the decision process [58]. Avoiding best-of-n comparisonsallows a potentially vulnerable colony to select the first nestencountered, if it is good enough. Perhaps even more important isdistributing the decision-making process, relying less on informa-tion-processing by a single individual; rather allowing the decisionA Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981to emerge from a collective process to which even partly-informedindividuals can contribute. In this colony-level cognition, therelevant information about the environment is represented withinthe individuals in a colony, their actions and interactions. At thecollective level this generates new information: which nest thecolony should choose [59]. In both bees and ants, the informationheld by individuals is integrated into a colony choice by means of aquorum threshold, which triggers rapid implementation of thedecision [18,60]. Although the colony will usually choose the sitewhich reaches quorum first, this does not mean that the colony asa whole must ‘satisfice’, accepting the first nest surpassing someminimum standard. Using quality-dependent initiation (in Tem-nothorax ants) or modulation (in honeybees) of the recruitmentprocess leading to the attainment of a quorum, the colony in effectcarries out a concurrent but indirect collective comparison process,which may implement optimal decision-making through theactions of partly-informed individuals [61]. This ensures that thenest to reach a quorum first is also likely to be the best option, evenwhen there is an array of possible alternatives [16,42]. Thuswithout the individuals using a ‘best-of-n’ comparison strategy, thecolony is able to solve a ‘best-of-n’ challenge [16,62].A further possible advantage of avoiding individual directcomparisons is that it would remove the risk of ‘irrational’ decisionbehaviour at the individual level [26], associated with comparative,relative evaluation of options such as best-of-n, or sequentialcomparisons. Individuals following our proposed threshold rulemake an absolute evaluation of quality, and this evaluation of oneoption is not influenced by the other alternatives available, incontrast to the context-dependent decision-making used by manyother animals including humans [8,63,64]. Although at thecollective level, a comparison between options is effectively beingmade, a non-comparative individual-level mechanism for thisdecision could protect the colony from irrationality in decision-making. For example, emigrating T. albipennis colonies followrational transitivity patterns in decision making [16] and in therelated species T. curvispinosus and T. rugatulus, colonies seem to beimmune to irrational distractor effects from irrelevant alternatives[25,65]. Although work on T. rugatulus suggests that this collectiveimmunity can emerge even if individuals are susceptible todistractor effects provided their individual contribution to thecollective decision is small [25], our work suggests this collectiverationality can emerge without depending on low numbers of antsvisiting both nests – if individual ants follow the threshold rule, thenthe colony can escape these irrational comparison behaviours.Using an absolute evaluation method does have a potentialdrawback, if the acceptance threshold is not appropriate to theenvironment. When used in individual decision making (e.g.during mate choice in cockroaches, [9]) the success of this sort ofsequential search strategy will be highly sensitive to the thresholdused. For example, if all available options are poor quality, ananimal may reject them all, and end up worse off than if it hadaccepted a poor option. In contrast, when this strategy is used forgroup decision making, variation in acceptance thresholds acrossthe group provides protection against this sensitivity. If all optionsare poor quality, some low-threshold individuals will still acceptone, allowing the group to make a choice. Similarly, intra-colonyvariation in task response thresholds promotes effective division oflabour in social insect colonies, with more individuals engaging ina particular task when the stimulus for that task increases [66–68].Our model assumes that individual thresholds are fixed over thetime-scale of the emigration process, however further flexibilitywould be available if acceptance thresholds were updated based onexperience over the course of an individual’s life-time [69,70].Flexible task thresholds promote flexible division of labour in socialinsect colonies [71–73]. How much acceptance threshold variationactually occurs within a colony, and whether ant acceptancethresholds are fixed throughout life or changed by experience, areissues remaining to be explored.In summary, our simple individual-threshold model is sufficientto explain empirical decision-making data, without assuming morecomplex behavioural mechanisms. Since the scientific methodgives preference to the more parsimonious model, this result showsthat care is needed in inferring individual behaviour from groupbehaviour. We propose that, in general, individual decision-makers can use this simple threshold rule to provide their groupwith an elegant solution to the problem of making a collectivechoice. This strategy allows the group to make a rational, well-informed and rapid decision.Supporting InformationFigure S1 ‘Expected decision time in a two-nest scenario.Expected time for an ant to accept any site across varying qualities(probabilities of acceptance) of sites A and B, calculated fromequation 2.(TIF)Figure S2 ‘Expected decision time in one-nest scenario.Expected time for an ant to accept any site, using the parametersof Figure 6, for the no-comparison threshold-rule of the main text(red), and for the direct-comparison threshold-rule describedabove (green).(TIF)Text S1 This supplementary model information coversdetails of model parameterisation for the analytical andsimulation modelling.

       "  'abstract': \"Decision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler, faster strategies to find a 'good enough' option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behaviours including foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study of a collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decision strategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possible decision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simple rule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can account parsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when available nests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. We present empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individual sequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able to effectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. This parsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Decision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler, faster strategies to find a 'good enough' option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behaviours including foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study of a collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decision strategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possible decision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simple rule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can account parsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when available nests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. We present empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individual sequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able to effectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. This parsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making\",\n",

A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to ExplainSophisticated Collective Decision-MakingElva J. H. Robinson1,2*, Nigel R. Franks1, Samuel Ellis1, Saki Okuda1, James A. R. Marshall31 School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom, 2 York Centre for Complex Systems Analysis, Department of Biology, University of York, York,United Kingdom, 3Department of Computer Science and Kroto Research Institute, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United KingdomAbstractDecision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler,faster strategies to find a \\u2018good enough\\u2019 option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behavioursincluding foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study ofa collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decisionstrategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possibledecision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simplerule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can accountparsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when availablenests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. Wepresent empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individualsequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able toeffectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. Thisparsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making.Citation: Robinson EJH, Franks NR, Ellis S, Okuda S, Marshall JAR (2011) A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making.

The fitness benefits of choosing the best option mean thatdecision-making strategies will be subject to natural selection. Mul-tiple comparison or \\u2018best of n\\u2019 strategies perform most accurately,and are likely to be optimal when searching and sampling costs arelow, e.g. on a lek [1,2] and when long-term fitness implications ofthe decision are high, e.g. in home range selection [3]. In othersituations, e.g. during foraging, there can be substantial time coststo making accurate decisions [4,5], and these costs can be so greatas to make quicker less accurate decisions more efficient [6]. Ani-mals may be best served by using a simpler \\u2018rule of thumb\\u2019, whichreduces sampling time, but still ensures the option they choose isgood enough. One simple but effective strategy is sequential searchin which the animal keeps searching until it finds an option thatexceeds a threshold of acceptability [2,7]. This kind of fixed-threshold strategy is used in foraging [8], mate choice [9] andrefuge selection [10]. An intermediate strategy is to allow thresh-olds to be influenced by experience of previous options; in effectthis would cause a \\u2018sequential comparison\\u2019.Social animals make collective decisions between availableoptions, particularly about where the group spends its time. Whenmaking a shared collective decision, a group faces the challenges ofintegrating information from multiple individuals and managingthe different decision-preferences of group members [11]. Suchdecisions are influenced by individual information, conflicts ofinterest and time-constraints [12,13]. To understand how a col-lective decision is reached, the rules followed by contributingmembers of the group must be identified [14]. Emigrating socialinsects are a good model system for the study of collective decision-making, because all members share the aim of coming to a con-sensus about a new, good nest site as soon as possible, but theinformation about available site quality is distributed very un-evenly within the colony [15,16]. To investigate the mechanismof decision making, we used models of, and experiments on,emigrating cavity-nesting rock ants, Temnothorax albipennis.A colony emigration by rock ants begins with scouts searchingfor and assessing new sites. Successful scouts recruit nest-matesusing tandem running, in which an informed ant leads another tothe new site [17]. When the number of ants at a site reaches a\\u2018quorum threshold\\u2019, the ants switch to rapid transport behaviour tocarry the brood, queen and remaining nest-mates to the new nest[18]. Ant colonies discriminate between nest sites on the basis of arange of attributes including cavity dimensions, light level andentrance width [16,19]. Three possible mechanisms by which thecolony collectively chooses the better of two nests have beenproposed: i) comparison ii) recruitment latency iii) threshold rule.PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981First, ants could use a comparison strategy, in which ants that havevisited both nests would compare their qualities and recruit nest-mates only to the better one [20]. Second, ants visiting just onenest could determine how long they hesitate before recruiting nest-mates (recruitment latency) based on the nest quality [20]. Acombination of these two mechanisms has been used as the basis ofseveral decision models [18,21\\u201324]. Although lone T. rugatulus antworkers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites whichare very close together [25], the evidence for individual antsmaking direct comparisons between nests during colony emigra-tion is weak [26], and furthermore, ant colonies are able to choosea distant good nest over a nearby poor nest, when recruitmentlatency differences would be expected to be cancelled out by traveltime (Fig. 1a) [26,27]. The third possible mechanism of choice is asequential search strategy, based on a very simple rule of thumb, a\\u2018threshold rule\\u2019, by which an ant assesses a nest against her ownfixed quality threshold, and either accepts the nest and beginsrecruitment, or rejects it and continues searching [26]. Quality-dependent recruitment latency has been demonstrated empiricallyonly when colonies were presented with a single new nest and werenot required to make a choice [20,22,24,28]. Robinson et al. [26]hypothesized that these apparent recruitment latency effects couldemerge as a by-product of a threshold rule, because ants that finda low-quality nest will tend to reject it and continue searching,whereas ants that find a high quality nest will tend to accept it andbegin recruitment. In addition, Robinson et al. [26] hypothesizedthat the apparent comparison phenomenon in which ants thathave visited equidistant poor and good nests usually recruit only tothe good nest (Fig. 1b; [20]) can be explained more parsimoniouslywith a threshold rule in which the poor nest is rejected and for-gotten, then the good nest is discovered and accepted, rather thanrequiring individual ants to perform the more cognitively complextask of remembering and comparing the qualities of different nests.We aim to test the hypothesis that this simple parsimoniousmechanism (the threshold rule) is sufficient to reproduce observedempirical patterns of collective decision-making.Here we present a Markov-chain model of decision-making,based on a simple threshold rule. Our model ants search for nests,and compare those they find to an internal acceptance threshold,subject to assessment error. This model includes no memory ofprevious nests, and no ability to make direct comparisons betweenthe nests an ant has encountered. It also includes no explicitquality-dependent recruitment latency. We compare the results ofthis model to empirical results from two published studies and onenew experiment, to test whether our model can produce thequalitative patterns seen in the empirical data. By parameterizingour model as far as possible to previous experiments [20,26] wetest whether this simple threshold-rule is sufficient to explainapparent recruitment latency and comparison effects. We also usethe model to predict emigration behaviour in a new experimentthat presents an ant colony with three equidistant nests, one goodand two poor (Fig. 1c). We performed this experiment usingindividually radio-tagged ants to monitor individual-level behav-iour and compare our empirical results to the model predictions.We thus test whether a very simple individual-level \\u2018rule of thumb\\u2019is sufficient to explain sophisticated collective decision-making.MethodsModelTo investigate the proposed threshold rule, we present a verysimple model. As we are only concerned with independent dis-covery by scouts before recruitment commences, we examine thecolony\\u2019s decision process analytically and using Monte-Carlo sim-ulation, modelling ants as independent instantiations of a Markovprocess. Ants independently accept sites according to a probabilityspecified by the site\\u2019s quality and their individual threshold, other-wise they search randomly for a site to assess (Fig. 2). We havemodelled a discontinuous acceptance function here, but this couldbe relaxed to be a smooth (e.g. sigmoidal) function of differencebetween internal threshold and sampled quality, without qualita-tively affecting the results. The Markov process has five states:\\u2018assessing home site\\u2019, \\u2018assessing poor site\\u2019, \\u2018assessing good site\\u2019,\\u2018committed to poor site\\u2019, and \\u2018committed to good site\\u2019. Allindividuals start in the \\u2018assessing home site\\u2019 state but the home siteis considered uninhabitable in the model, and its quality is set toFigure 1. Arenas used in emigration experiments, showing nestlocations. Dashed outline= old destroyed nest; shading= good nests.(A) Good nest 120 cm from old nest; poor nest 30 cm [26]. (B)Equidistant good and poor nests 45 cm from old nest [20]. (C) Threeequidistant new nests 36 cm from old nest.

A simulated ant continues searchinguntil it encounters a nest of a quality (b) exceeding the ant\\u2019s individualthreshold (a), taking into account assessment error (e). Ants may revisitthe same nest (with probability r), and do not have any memory ofpreviously visited nests.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019981.g002A Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981negative infinity, therefore an ant can never become committed toit. Ants can switch between the assessment states, but we assumethat once committed to a site an ant remains so and recruits nest-mates to its preferred option; the recruitment process is not mod-elled, and the \\u2018committed\\u2019 states are therefore absorbing states.For the Monte-Carlo simulations, we model nest quality accep-tance thresholds in the colony as a normally distributed randomvariable A, with some mean and variance. An individual simulatedant has a quality acceptance threshold a drawn at random fromthis distribution. It discovers its next nest by sampling from aprobability distribution specified by its current nest, arena size andshape, and the proximities of other available nest sites (Table 1);part of this distribution is determined by the probability r that arandomly searching scout rediscovers the site it has just been in.On discovering a site, the scout evaluates the quality of the currentnest site with some error e added, sampled from a standard normaldistribution (mean 0; standard deviation 1); this corresponds toerror in the scout\\u2019s quality assessment. If this sampled qualityexceeds the scout\\u2019s acceptance threshold then it becomes com-mitted to the site, otherwise it continues searching (Fig. 2). Accep-tance threshold distributions and nest qualities are given arbitraryvalues (Table 1), because individual probabilities of becomingcommitted to a nest are hard to estimate empirically, due to thedifficulties in accurately identifying commitment and in eliminat-ing the effects of interactions between ants. In the model, traveltimes between sites are sampled from normal distributions. Byparameterizing this model to empirical ant movement speed andspecific experimental arenas (Table 1), we can approximate theexpected time for each simulated ant to find each nest, and thetime from first finding a nest to becoming committed to it (the antmay visit other nests in between, or visit the same nest many timesbefore committing to it). This allows us to calculate recruitmentlatencies for comparison with empirical data. In the empiricalstudies, recruitment latency concerns the time from discovering anest to first recruiting to that nest. We do not include recruitmentin the model, so modelled recruitment latency concerns the timefrom discovering a nest to \\u2018accepting\\u2019 that nest. For real antcolonies, searching behaviour is much reduced when quorum isachieved; we truncate the simulated data at the time at whichquorum was achieved in the real experiment, to increase com-parability (see Text S1).Model Analysis. In addition to the simulation model de-scribed in this paper, we can derive analytic results for the pro-posed rule for switching between nests. To facilitate this analysiswe simplify the Markov process slightly from that used in theMonte-Carlo simulations, by discarding the state of assessing thehome site. The four states in the simplified Markov process arethus \\u2018assessing poor site\\u2019, \\u2018assessing good site\\u2019, \\u2018committed to poorsite\\u2019, and \\u2018committed to good site\\u2019, and the state transition matrixis (with states ordered as described above from top to bottom andfrom left to right)Q~(1{p)r (1{g)(1{r) 0 0(1{p)(1{r) (1{g)r 0 0p 0 1 00 g 0 10BBB@1CCCA, \\u00f01\\u00dewhere p is the average per-visit probability that an ant accepts thepoor site, g is the average per-visit probability that an ant acceptsthe good site, and r is the probability that a randomly searchingscout rediscovers the site it has just been in.

The probability distribution over theinitial states (\\u2018assessing poor site\\u2019 and \\u2018assessing good site\\u2019) can bederived based on the relative probabilities of an arbitrary ant scoutdiscovering either when searching from the home site.Using standard techniques [e.g. 29] we derive analytic results onthe long-run behaviour of the threshold-switching rule, using thestate transition matrix Q (eq. 1) and its fundamental matrix. Ofparticular relevance to our proposals is the analysis of the expectedtime for the Markov-process to reach any absorbing state, whenstarted in some particular non-absorbing state. If we assume bothcandidate nest sites are equally likely to be discovered first from thehome site, then the expected number of steps in the Markov-chainbefore commitment to either nest site is reached is given byE(time to accept any site)~4(1{r)z2r(pzg){p{g2((2r{1)pgz(1{r)(pzg)): \\u00f02\\u00deEquation (2) will be used below to examine the sensitivity ofacceptance time to changes in site qualities. Note that, technically,we should be interested in the latency between discovering aparticular site, and recruiting to that site, however in general per-state latencies are difficult to calculate in Markov-chains, and theoverall expected latency given in equation 2 is an acceptable sim-plification (see Text S1).Empirical methodsEthics statement. Our experiments on T. albipennis andcollection of colonies from the field comply with the laws of thecountry in which they were carried out and the relevant nationaland international guidelines [30,31].\\u2018Three-New-Nests\\u2019 Experiment. Six T. albipennis colonieswere collected from the Dorset coast, England, June\\u2013July 2009.Colonies were queenright and contained 80\\u2013200 workers andbrood of all stages. Colonies were housed in artificial nests [27]and provided with water ad libitum and honey solution andDrosophila melanogaster weekly. We used these colonies to investigatedecision-making when a colony was offered a choice of three newnests. Six trials were performed, each with a new colony. One dayprior to an emigration trial, we attached an RFID micro-transponder (50065006120 mm) with a unique ID to the thoraxof every worker ant in the colony [32,33] and housed the colony ina nest formed of a hexagonal glass slide (edge length = 30 mm), a1.5 mm cardboard perimeter (cavity area 1496 mm2) and anacetate lid with a central entrance hole (1.5 mm diameter) to avoidintroducing directional bias. We performed trials in a circulararena with Fluon-coated sides, the floor of which was cleaned withwater and alcohol between trials. Three new hexagonal nests withthe same dimensions as the original nest were placed in the arena(Fig. 1c). Two nests had clear acetate lids and one had a red filtercovering the cavity area, making the nest appear relatively dark tothe ants [34]. Ant colonies choose dark over light nests [19]. Theposition of the good nest was interchanged between trials. Thenew nests had 1.5 mm wide entrances in the side facing the centreof the arena, over which RFID readers (PharmaSeq, Inc., NJ) wereplaced vertically. A trial began with the original nest placed in thecentre of the arena and then destroyed by removing the lid. TheRFID readers detected ants entering and leaving the new nests[86% tag read rate, 26] and we used handheld RFID readers toread the tags on tandem-running ants (94% tag read rate) as theycrossed half-way lines (Fig. 1c). The identity of the leader andfollower was thus recorded and the direction of the tandem runwas noted. This procedure does not disrupt tandem runs [26]. Thetime at which the transport by carrying of a nest-mate or a brooditem first occurred to each nest was recorded (i.e. the time at whichthe quorum threshold was reached). Once nest-mate transport hascommenced, the RFID system becomes less reliable [26], becausenest-mates are transported in such a way as to block the RFID tag.We therefore focused our analysis on searching and recruitment bytandem-running during the pre-quorum period. We observedemigrations until complete (old nest empty of brood and workers)and recorded the nest choice of the colony after 24 hours. Colo-nies were considered to have split if brood was present in two ormore nests.Statistical MethodsMean recruitment latencies were analysed using generalisedlinear mixed models (GLMM) \\u2018glmmPQL\\u2019 in the MASS library inR 2.4.1 with nest quality as a fixed factor, colony (empirical results)or replicate (simulation results) as a random factor and a Poissonerror structure. Differences between recruitment latency survivor-ship curves, were tested using generalized log-rank tests using thefunction \\u2018survdiff\\u2019 in the survival library in R 2.4.1. Monte Carlosimulations were carried out using MatLab 7.4.0 (see Text S1),and matrix manipulation with Maple 14.ResultsComparison with Poor Nest Near; Good Nest Far DataWe parameterized the model to the experimental set-up used byRobinson et al. [26] with a nearby poor nest and a more distantgood nest (Table 1, Fig. 1a) and performed Monte Carlo simu-lations of this experiment. The switching behaviour (ants movingfrom visiting one nest to visiting the other) in the simulations isqualitatively very similar to the empirical data (Fig. 3). In bothcases most ants that find the far (good) nest first stay at that nest,whereas ants that find the near (poor) nest first may stay or switch.The model simulations also reproduce the empirical results thatrecruitment latency does not play an important role here. In theempirical study, recruitment latency was measured as time fromdiscovering a nest to first leading a tandem run to that nest anddata are only available for ants which recruited by tandem-running. There are more recruitment latencies for the simulateddata, as all ants make a choice in the model, whereas in the realdata not all active ants perform tandem runs. This leads toquantitative differences between simulated and empirical data, butqualitatively the patterns are the same: In the simulated data, as inthe empirical data, there are no significant differences betweenrecruitment latencies to the good and poor nests (Fig. 4a, 4b).However, in a simulation presenting the two nests separately (i.e.either only old nest and near poor nest are present, or only old nestand far good nest are present) the pattern is dramatically different,with significantly higher recruitment latencies for the poor nest(Fig. 4c). This clearly demonstrates that differences in recruitmentlatency can be generated when only one nest is present, as a side-effect of the threshold rule.Comparison with Two-Equidistant-Nests DataTo test whether our model can account for the patterns seen inthe original experiments, used as evidence for the recruitmentlatency and comparison mechanisms [20], we also parameterisedthe Monte Carlo model to this experimental set-up (Fig. 1b,Table 1). Here two equidistant new nests, one good and one poor,are presented to the ant colony. The empirical data for directcomparison are shown in Table 2. Very similar results emerge inour simulations, without any memory or comparison coded intothe model (Table 2), clearly showing that this sort of behaviouralpattern can be accounted for by the threshold rule alone, withoutA Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981needing to include other mechanisms. However, the exact quan-titative results of our simulations are influenced by the acceptancethreshold and nest quality parameters. Since we do not know theshape of the real threshold distribution in an ant colony, the matchbetween simulated and empirical data here does not prove thatcomparison plays no role in ant decision-making, but does showthat results of this type do not necessarily have to be the producedby comparative evaluation.In the empirical data (Fig. 5a\\u2013f), there do appear to be quality-dependent differences in recruitment latency \\u2013 however, the nestswere presented separately in these experiments. Recruitmentlatency is measured using survival analysis, treating ants that find asite but never recruit to it as censored data. Applying the sameanalysis to our simulated results demonstrates that we can repli-cate these differences in recruitment latency when the nests arepresented separately (Fig. 5g\\u2013l) but the differences disappear whenthe simulations are repeated identically, but with the nestspresented together (Fig. 5m\\u2013r). This is same pattern as wasobserved in the comparison with the the \\u2018poor nest near; good nestfar\\u2019 data, even though recruitment latencies are measureddifferently in the two empirical studies. These simulation resultsdemonstrate that the observed empirical differences in recruitmentFigure 3. Comparison of empirical and simulated emigration behavior. Number of ants continuing to visit the same nest (stay) or going onto visit the other nest (switch), depends on the quality of the first nest visited. (A) Empirical results, 9 colonies, mean + SD.

We consider the two site case first; todo this we shall hold one of the nest site qualities constant whilevarying the other nest site quality, and examine the effect on theexpected time to reach commitment to either site. Figure 6illustrates how expected decision time varies for the one and twosite cases, for a given revisiting value of r (0.7, estimated fromempirical data). We vary the quality of the poor site (A) whilekeeping the quality of the good site (B) constant, holding g constantwhile varying p in the interval [0, 1] (see eq. 2). For a moderatequality of the constant nest (P(accept B) = g=0.88, estimated fromempirical data) expected decision time varies little between theextremes of the other nest\\u2019s quality (P(accept A) = p=0 to 1), thuswhen two nest sites are present, strong quality dependent recruit-ment latency is not evident (Fig. 6, solid line). This contrastsmarkedly with the situation where there is only one potential nestsite; this is equivalent to setting p= g in equation 2. Now a muchmore pronounced relationship between the quality of this site, andthe expected time until commitment, is evident (Fig. 6, dashedline). These analytic results agree qualitatively with results fromthe Monte-Carlo simulation (Fig. 5). This is good evidence forthe threshold rule, but does not in itself rule out sequential com-parisons since a version of the model with sequential comparisonsgives almost indistinguishable results (see Text S1, Fig. S2). How-ever, the sequential comparison model makes greater cognitivedemands on individuals, who must remember the qualities ofvisited sites and evaluate this in making subsequent comparisons.Three-New-Nests: Simulation Predictions and EmpiricalDataA total of 752 ants (across 6 colonies) were individually radio-tagged and their scouting activity was monitored during emi-gration experiments in which each colony chose between onegood and two poor nests (Fig. 1c). According to the thresholdrule, ants which independently (i.e. not by following a tandemrun) visit the good nest (A) and one of the poor nests (designatedB) and then visited another nest before quorum was reached (atwhich point carrying behaviour begins), should be equally likelyto return to good nest A or discover the other, equidistant, poornest (designated C). In contrast, if ants are using best-of-n directcomparisons, ants which have visited good nest A and then nest Bshould be more likely to return to A than to discover C.In the empirical data, 20 individuals out of the 752 wemonitored fulfilled the necessary behavioural criteria of finding Aand then B before quorum was reached. This sample size is smallbecause this behaviour was fairly rare \\u2013 as would be predicted byour model, ants finding A tended to start recruiting, rather thandiscover B. Using this sample size of 20 ants for 100 simulationreplicates gives 95% confidence intervals of 7\\u201312 ants returning toA; 8\\u201313 ants discovering C. The empirical data fit well withinthese limits, with 11 ants returning to A and 9 discovering C. Thisdoes not differ significantly from random choice (binomial test,P=0.82). This supports the threshold hypothesis and shows noevidence that ants act on information from comparison of nests toallow them to preferentially return to a better nest.Although our data show that ants did not preferentially returnto the good nest, the comparison hypothesis could still be sup-ported if those that did return to it did so more directly becausethey had remembered its high quality. This is not the case: antsmade 0\\u201327 (median= 3) repeat visits to B before returning to A,compared to 0\\u20136 (median= 0) visits to B before discovering C(Mann-Whitney test: U=73, N=20, P=0.07). The trend is in theopposite direction to that predicted by the hypothesis that antsmake a comparison and act on it to return more directly to betternests. These data are consistent with threshold-based choice.A second test of whether individual ants are comparing nestsinvolves decisions to recruit nest-mates by leading a tandem-runto the new nest. If ants are using a \\u2018best-of-n\\u2019 comparison strategy,the sampling period before recruiting should be independent ofthe quality of the first nest they visit, whereas if ants use aninternal threshold rule, the number of nests they sample beforerecruiting should be strongly dependent on the quality of the firstnest they visit, with ants that find the high quality nest first beinglikely to initiate recruitment to this nest immediately. In theempirical data, 13 individual ants initiated recruitment by leadinga tandem run, of which 8 had discovered the good nest first, and 5had discovered a poor nest first. Using these sample sizes for 100simulation replicates predicts that ants finding the good nest firstshould not visit any other nest before recruiting (median totalnests visited: 95%CI 1-1) whereas ants finding the poor nest firstshould be more likely to visit other nests before recruiting (mediantotal nests visited 95%CI 1-2). The empirical data fit thesepredictions. Ants which found the good nest first visited a medianof only that 1 nest before recruiting, whereas those which foundthe poor nest visited a median of 2 different nests before leading atandem run (Mann-Whitney test, U=36, N=13, P,0.05). Thedata do not support the recruitment latency mechanism, as thereare no quality-dependent differences in time from nest discov-ery to recruitment by tandem-running (good nest: mean 6SD= 20619 min; poor nest: mean 6 SD=28624 min; t-test:t12=0.71, P=0.49).DiscussionOur results show that a very simple individual mechanism canproduce effective collective decision-making. The predictions ofour threshold decision-making model correspond well withempirical data from house-hunting ants. Our simulations of theTable 2.

This explanationof empirical data is supported by our analytical modelling results.Our results clearly support the hypothesis that this simple par-simonious mechanism (the threshold rule) is sufficient to reproduceobserved empirical patterns of collective decision-making: ourresults can account for both apparent direct comparison of nestquality and for apparent quality-dependent recruitment latency,which had been previously proposed as mechanisms of collectivechoice. Our parsimonious threshold model is sufficient to explainthe data without assuming more complex behavioural mecha-nisms. This highlights the need for carefully designed experimentsto determine whether or not individuals make comparisons, anddemonstrates that group-level comparison behaviour does notnecessarily imply individual-level comparison behaviour. In thecase of ants, evidence of the ability of lone individuals to makedirect comparisons of alternatives has only recently been published[25]; as our results show, previously published studies were notsufficient to demonstrate this. Further empirical investigation isrequired to establish what role, if any, direct comparison by in-dividual ants plays in the collective decision-process.We can subdivide comparison behaviour into two types thatcan aid decision-making: best-of-n comparisons and sequentialcomparisons. Best-of-n comparison mechanisms are characterisedby a sampling period, and preferential return to the best option[35]. We conducted a multiple-nest experiment to test directly ifreal ants show these behaviours. Neither is observed. In contrast,the results support the threshold model: if the first nest theyencountered was of a high quality, the ants started recruitmentimmediately without continuing to sample, and those ants whichhad the opportunity to compare nests did not act on this infor-mation by preferential or more direct return to better nests.Sequential comparisons occur when each time an animal en-counters a new option, it compares the new option to its memoryof previously encountered options and is more likely to accept thenew one if it compares favourably. This is similar to the thresholdmodel, but thresholds are influenced by experience. In one variantof this, individuals sample several options and then accept the nextoption they encounter which exceeds the quality of all previousoptions. This strategy can be shown to provide the optimalsolution to the \\u2018secretary problem\\u2019; a sequential search problem inwhich previously encountered options are subsequently unavail-able [36]. We modelled a sequential comparison mechanism (seeText S1) to compare with our threshold model. The results showthat this type of comparison model predicts similar recruitmentlatency results to our threshold model. We therefore cannot ruleout this sequential comparison mechanism, but note that it is a lessparsimonious solution. Our threshold model is sufficient to explainthe data without invoking memory and comparison during thedecision process.Our simulated ants have no memory of previously visited nests,and yet behaviour previously described as \\u2018comparison\\u2019 stillemerges in our simulations (Table 2). This clearly shows thatempirical data of this sort cannot be used as evidence that ananimal is really remembering and comparing. The decisionprocess we propose is \\u2018memoryless\\u2019 in the sense that individualants do not have to remember previously visited alternativesduring their search for an acceptable nest. Our model deals onlywith the decision process up to the point at which an ant accepts anest. After that point, real ants clearly do use memory of nestlocation in order to recruit nest-mates to that nest by tandem-running [20]. Recruitment is the most easily identifiable actionindicating commitment, but ants that have accepted a nest mayalso act on their commitment by making repeat visits to the nest[26,37]. By making repeat visits, ants are able to assess nest areamore accurately [37] and would also contribute to the accumu-lation of a quorum at their chosen nest, causing the switch to rapidnest-mate carrying behaviour [18]. Memory is therefore animportant part of the implementation of the decision, but antsfollowing the threshold rule do not need to invest in rememberingthe qualities or locations of multiple nests during the decision-making process.Figure 6.

The initial advantage is amplified by recruitment, and thiscan be shown to be sufficient to account for collective choice [24].In both the threshold rule and the recruitment latency hypothesis,a scout makes a probabilistic, quality-dependent decision aboutwhether to recruit each time she visits a nest. The differencebetween these mechanisms come from the assumptions madeabout what the scout does after leaving the nest, and how thisresults in a colony decision-mechanism. In our threshold rule, theant either commits or continues searching. In the recruitmentlatency hypothesis, ants which do not immediately start recruitingmay subsequently recruit, with a quality-dependent latency. In theoriginal formulation of this idea [20] it is mentioned that antsmight discover other nests during this latent period, but it is notsuggested that the latency is actually a result of the search for othernests. Searching for alternatives has a more prominent role in laterversions of the recruitment latency model [24] making it moresimilar to our threshold model, however, the idea of simplequality-dependent recruitment latencies functioning as a choicemechanism still appears often in discussions of collective decision-making [11,38,39]. There are two empirical problems with such amechanism. Firstly, colonies are able to choose a good nest, evenwhen it is so much further away than a poor nest that travel timeshould cancel out differences in recruitment latency [27]. Sec-ondly, all empirical evidence for quality-dependent recruitmentlatencies comes from studies offering a colony just one new nest[20,22,24,28]. When recruitment latencies are measured inmultiple nest experiments, no quality-dependent recruitmentlatencies differences are observed [this study and 26]. We usedmodelling to investigate these empirical results. Our simulationand analytical results reproduce quality-dependent recruitmentlatency in a single-nest experiment, but show that the presence ofan extra nest disrupts the quality-dependence of the latency tocommitment and recruitment (Figs. 5\\u20136). When a single poor nestis offered, acceptance times in the model will be geometricallydistributed, with few ants accepting the site early due to rareassessment errors or low individual-thresholds, and the remaindercontinuing to re-assess the same site until they eventually decide itis good enough. When a second higher quality site is introduced,the same small proportion of ants will accept the poor site earlydue to low-threshold or assessment error, but the remainder willnow tend to discover the alternative, superior site, and recruitto this quickly on average because of its increased quality. Thesame pattern would be observed for a threshold-rule with directcomparison (see Text S1), and also for a quality-dependent re-cruitment latency-rule, if it is assumed that ants search foralternatives during the latency period and have a high probabilityof finding other sites [20]. However, these alternative models areless parsimonious, requiring ants to remember the qualities and/orlocations of visited sites and evaluate this in making subsequentcomparisons or use the information to decide when and where tostart recruiting. These results also clearly demonstrate that aphenomenon observed when only one option is available, cannotbe assumed to function in the same way when choosing betweenmultiple options (see also [7]).Another well-studied example of collective decision-making isnest-site choice by swarming honeybees (Apis mellifera). Like antcolonies, bee swarms are able to choose between different nestsites, and individual bees do not need to have visited multiple sitesfor the swarm to be able to choose between them [40]. However,the way the scouts act on this information differs between the twogroups. The ants seem to use a binary decision process to eitheraccept that nest or continue searching. Ants accepting a nestrecruit others, causing a positive feedback process, but ant scoutsdo not modulate their recruitment according to nest quality, e.g.by recruiting at a faster rate or for longer to a higher quality nest[20,26]. In contrast, bees use a graded process, whereby scoutsinitially discovering a new nest-site almost always recruit [41],but the duration and rate of the recruiting waggle-dances aredependent on nest quality [42]. This means that more recruits arebrought to better nest-sites, leading to a positive feedback processusually resulting in a unanimous choice of the better site [42]. Onepossible reason for this difference in strategy could be differencesin nest availability: if suitable honeybee nest sites are relativelyrare, then it might be better for scouts to avoid ever rejecting apotential nest outright.Collective decisions are also made in other contexts, such aschoice of foraging site. Here again, comparisons of sites by indi-viduals seems to play little role. Foraging honeybees do not com-pare food sources [43], nor do they compare the waggle-dances ofrecruiters at the hive [44]. Rather, multiple sites \\u2018compete\\u2019 forforagers, with bees foraging more persistently at high quality sitesand recruiting to them more energetically [43,45]. Foragers canalso directly inhibit recruitment if they perceive danger at a par-ticular food source by the use of \\u2018stop-signals\\u2019 directed at beesrecruiting to that source [46]. In trail-laying ants and bees,pheromone trails to better foraging sites are more stronglyreinforced and this again leads to a collective choice without anynecessity for individuals to visit multiple sites [47,48]. Just as fornest-site choice, foraging recruitment can either be graded (layingmore pheromone to a better food source, e.g. [47,49]) or a binarydecision (all-or-nothing recruitment, e.g. [50,51]).Direct comparison of alternatives is seen in a range of animalsand contexts, including foraging in scrub jays and humans [8,52],mate choice in bower-birds and dance-flies [53,54] and shellassessment by hermit crabs [55]. A best-of-n comparison strategywould maximise decision accuracy [2], so why do neither indi-vidual bees nor ants appear to use this strategy when foraging orchoosing a new home? One possibility is that multiple comparisonsare too cognitively complex for ant and bee brains. However,small insects including bees are competent at related cognitiveprocesses, including contextual learning, discrimination betweenstimuli and associative recall [56]. Male dance-flies compare thesize of potential mates before choosing [54], and there is evidenceto suggest that honeybee workers are capable of comparativeevaluation of flowers [57] and that lone T. rugatulus ant workers arecapable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are veryclose together [25]. There may, therefore, be reasons other thancognitive constraints for why relying on individual best-of-ncomparisons to inform collective choices does not appear to haveevolved as a decision mechanism in bees or ants. One possiblereason is that during their evolutionary history the ants havetypically been faced with decisions about whether to accept asingle option at a time, rather than simultaneously having in-formation about multiple options, and this has shaped theevolution of their decision process [7]. Another possible reason isthe potential speed advantage of avoiding a sampling period.Sampling periods can be costly [2,7] and pose the mathematicallycomplex problem of deciding how long to sample for beforestarting the decision process [58]. Avoiding best-of-n comparisonsallows a potentially vulnerable colony to select the first nestencountered, if it is good enough. Perhaps even more important isdistributing the decision-making process, relying less on informa-tion-processing by a single individual; rather allowing the decisionA Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981to emerge from a collective process to which even partly-informedindividuals can contribute. In this colony-level cognition, therelevant information about the environment is represented withinthe individuals in a colony, their actions and interactions. At thecollective level this generates new information: which nest thecolony should choose [59]. In both bees and ants, the informationheld by individuals is integrated into a colony choice by means of aquorum threshold, which triggers rapid implementation of thedecision [18,60]. Although the colony will usually choose the sitewhich reaches quorum first, this does not mean that the colony asa whole must \\u2018satisfice\\u2019, accepting the first nest surpassing someminimum standard. Using quality-dependent initiation (in Tem-nothorax ants) or modulation (in honeybees) of the recruitmentprocess leading to the attainment of a quorum, the colony in effectcarries out a concurrent but indirect collective comparison process,which may implement optimal decision-making through theactions of partly-informed individuals [61]. This ensures that thenest to reach a quorum first is also likely to be the best option, evenwhen there is an array of possible alternatives [16,42]. Thuswithout the individuals using a \\u2018best-of-n\\u2019 comparison strategy, thecolony is able to solve a \\u2018best-of-n\\u2019 challenge [16,62].A further possible advantage of avoiding individual directcomparisons is that it would remove the risk of \\u2018irrational\\u2019 decisionbehaviour at the individual level [26], associated with comparative,relative evaluation of options such as best-of-n, or sequentialcomparisons. Individuals following our proposed threshold rulemake an absolute evaluation of quality, and this evaluation of oneoption is not influenced by the other alternatives available, incontrast to the context-dependent decision-making used by manyother animals including humans [8,63,64]. Although at thecollective level, a comparison between options is effectively beingmade, a non-comparative individual-level mechanism for thisdecision could protect the colony from irrationality in decision-making. For example, emigrating T. albipennis colonies followrational transitivity patterns in decision making [16] and in therelated species T. curvispinosus and T. rugatulus, colonies seem to beimmune to irrational distractor effects from irrelevant alternatives[25,65]. Although work on T. rugatulus suggests that this collectiveimmunity can emerge even if individuals are susceptible todistractor effects provided their individual contribution to thecollective decision is small [25], our work suggests this collectiverationality can emerge without depending on low numbers of antsvisiting both nests \\u2013 if individual ants follow the threshold rule, thenthe colony can escape these irrational comparison behaviours.Using an absolute evaluation method does have a potentialdrawback, if the acceptance threshold is not appropriate to theenvironment. When used in individual decision making (e.g.during mate choice in cockroaches, [9]) the success of this sort ofsequential search strategy will be highly sensitive to the thresholdused. For example, if all available options are poor quality, ananimal may reject them all, and end up worse off than if it hadaccepted a poor option. In contrast, when this strategy is used forgroup decision making, variation in acceptance thresholds acrossthe group provides protection against this sensitivity. If all optionsare poor quality, some low-threshold individuals will still acceptone, allowing the group to make a choice. Similarly, intra-colonyvariation in task response thresholds promotes effective division oflabour in social insect colonies, with more individuals engaging ina particular task when the stimulus for that task increases [66\\u201368].Our model assumes that individual thresholds are fixed over thetime-scale of the emigration process, however further flexibilitywould be available if acceptance thresholds were updated based onexperience over the course of an individual\\u2019s life-time [69,70].Flexible task thresholds promote flexible division of labour in socialinsect colonies [71\\u201373]. How much acceptance threshold variationactually occurs within a colony, and whether ant acceptancethresholds are fixed throughout life or changed by experience, areissues remaining to be explored.In summary, our simple individual-threshold model is sufficientto explain empirical decision-making data, without assuming morecomplex behavioural mechanisms. Since the scientific methodgives preference to the more parsimonious model, this result showsthat care is needed in inferring individual behaviour from groupbehaviour. We propose that, in general, individual decision-makers can use this simple threshold rule to provide their groupwith an elegant solution to the problem of making a collectivechoice. This strategy allows the group to make a rational, well-informed and rapid decision.Supporting InformationFigure S1 \\u2018Expected decision time in a two-nest scenario.Expected time for an ant to accept any site across varying qualities(probabilities of acceptance) of sites A and B, calculated fromequation 2.(TIF)Figure S2 \\u2018Expected decision time in one-nest scenario.Expected time for an ant to accept any site, using the parametersof Figure 6, for the no-comparison threshold-rule of the main text(red), and for the direct-comparison threshold-rule describedabove (green).(TIF)Text S1 This supplementary model information coversdetails of model parameterisation for the analytical andsimulation modelling.

      "  \"abstract\": \"Decision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler, faster strategies to find a 'good enough' option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behaviours including foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study of a collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decision strategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possible decision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simple rule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can account parsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when available nests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. We present empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individual sequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able to effectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. This parsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making\",\n",

A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to ExplainSophisticated Collective Decision-MakingElva J. H. Robinson1,2*, Nigel R. Franks1, Samuel Ellis1, Saki Okuda1, James A. R. Marshall31 School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom, 2 York Centre for Complex Systems Analysis, Department of Biology, University of York, York,United Kingdom, 3Department of Computer Science and Kroto Research Institute, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United KingdomAbstractDecision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler,faster strategies to find a ‘good enough’ option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behavioursincluding foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study ofa collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decisionstrategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possibledecision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simplerule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can accountparsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when availablenests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. Wepresent empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individualsequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able toeffectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. Thisparsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making.Citation: Robinson EJH, Franks NR, Ellis S, Okuda S, Marshall JAR (2011) A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making.

The fitness benefits of choosing the best option mean thatdecision-making strategies will be subject to natural selection. Mul-tiple comparison or ‘best of n’ strategies perform most accurately,and are likely to be optimal when searching and sampling costs arelow, e.g. on a lek [1,2] and when long-term fitness implications ofthe decision are high, e.g. in home range selection [3]. In othersituations, e.g. during foraging, there can be substantial time coststo making accurate decisions [4,5], and these costs can be so greatas to make quicker less accurate decisions more efficient [6]. Ani-mals may be best served by using a simpler ‘rule of thumb’, whichreduces sampling time, but still ensures the option they choose isgood enough. One simple but effective strategy is sequential searchin which the animal keeps searching until it finds an option thatexceeds a threshold of acceptability [2,7]. This kind of fixed-threshold strategy is used in foraging [8], mate choice [9] andrefuge selection [10]. An intermediate strategy is to allow thresh-olds to be influenced by experience of previous options; in effectthis would cause a ‘sequential comparison’.Social animals make collective decisions between availableoptions, particularly about where the group spends its time. Whenmaking a shared collective decision, a group faces the challenges ofintegrating information from multiple individuals and managingthe different decision-preferences of group members [11]. Suchdecisions are influenced by individual information, conflicts ofinterest and time-constraints [12,13]. To understand how a col-lective decision is reached, the rules followed by contributingmembers of the group must be identified [14]. Emigrating socialinsects are a good model system for the study of collective decision-making, because all members share the aim of coming to a con-sensus about a new, good nest site as soon as possible, but theinformation about available site quality is distributed very un-evenly within the colony [15,16]. To investigate the mechanismof decision making, we used models of, and experiments on,emigrating cavity-nesting rock ants, Temnothorax albipennis.A colony emigration by rock ants begins with scouts searchingfor and assessing new sites. Successful scouts recruit nest-matesusing tandem running, in which an informed ant leads another tothe new site [17]. When the number of ants at a site reaches a‘quorum threshold’, the ants switch to rapid transport behaviour tocarry the brood, queen and remaining nest-mates to the new nest[18]. Ant colonies discriminate between nest sites on the basis of arange of attributes including cavity dimensions, light level andentrance width [16,19]. Three possible mechanisms by which thecolony collectively chooses the better of two nests have beenproposed: i) comparison ii) recruitment latency iii) threshold rule.PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981First, ants could use a comparison strategy, in which ants that havevisited both nests would compare their qualities and recruit nest-mates only to the better one [20]. Second, ants visiting just onenest could determine how long they hesitate before recruiting nest-mates (recruitment latency) based on the nest quality [20]. Acombination of these two mechanisms has been used as the basis ofseveral decision models [18,21–24]. Although lone T. rugatulus antworkers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites whichare very close together [25], the evidence for individual antsmaking direct comparisons between nests during colony emigra-tion is weak [26], and furthermore, ant colonies are able to choosea distant good nest over a nearby poor nest, when recruitmentlatency differences would be expected to be cancelled out by traveltime (Fig. 1a) [26,27]. The third possible mechanism of choice is asequential search strategy, based on a very simple rule of thumb, a‘threshold rule’, by which an ant assesses a nest against her ownfixed quality threshold, and either accepts the nest and beginsrecruitment, or rejects it and continues searching [26]. Quality-dependent recruitment latency has been demonstrated empiricallyonly when colonies were presented with a single new nest and werenot required to make a choice [20,22,24,28]. Robinson et al. [26]hypothesized that these apparent recruitment latency effects couldemerge as a by-product of a threshold rule, because ants that finda low-quality nest will tend to reject it and continue searching,whereas ants that find a high quality nest will tend to accept it andbegin recruitment. In addition, Robinson et al. [26] hypothesizedthat the apparent comparison phenomenon in which ants thathave visited equidistant poor and good nests usually recruit only tothe good nest (Fig. 1b; [20]) can be explained more parsimoniouslywith a threshold rule in which the poor nest is rejected and for-gotten, then the good nest is discovered and accepted, rather thanrequiring individual ants to perform the more cognitively complextask of remembering and comparing the qualities of different nests.We aim to test the hypothesis that this simple parsimoniousmechanism (the threshold rule) is sufficient to reproduce observedempirical patterns of collective decision-making.Here we present a Markov-chain model of decision-making,based on a simple threshold rule. Our model ants search for nests,and compare those they find to an internal acceptance threshold,subject to assessment error. This model includes no memory ofprevious nests, and no ability to make direct comparisons betweenthe nests an ant has encountered. It also includes no explicitquality-dependent recruitment latency. We compare the results ofthis model to empirical results from two published studies and onenew experiment, to test whether our model can produce thequalitative patterns seen in the empirical data. By parameterizingour model as far as possible to previous experiments [20,26] wetest whether this simple threshold-rule is sufficient to explainapparent recruitment latency and comparison effects. We also usethe model to predict emigration behaviour in a new experimentthat presents an ant colony with three equidistant nests, one goodand two poor (Fig. 1c). We performed this experiment usingindividually radio-tagged ants to monitor individual-level behav-iour and compare our empirical results to the model predictions.We thus test whether a very simple individual-level ‘rule of thumb’is sufficient to explain sophisticated collective decision-making.MethodsModelTo investigate the proposed threshold rule, we present a verysimple model. As we are only concerned with independent dis-covery by scouts before recruitment commences, we examine thecolony’s decision process analytically and using Monte-Carlo sim-ulation, modelling ants as independent instantiations of a Markovprocess. Ants independently accept sites according to a probabilityspecified by the site’s quality and their individual threshold, other-wise they search randomly for a site to assess (Fig. 2). We havemodelled a discontinuous acceptance function here, but this couldbe relaxed to be a smooth (e.g. sigmoidal) function of differencebetween internal threshold and sampled quality, without qualita-tively affecting the results. The Markov process has five states:‘assessing home site’, ‘assessing poor site’, ‘assessing good site’,‘committed to poor site’, and ‘committed to good site’. Allindividuals start in the ‘assessing home site’ state but the home siteis considered uninhabitable in the model, and its quality is set toFigure 1.

A simulated ant continues searchinguntil it encounters a nest of a quality (b) exceeding the ant’s individualthreshold (a), taking into account assessment error (e). Ants may revisitthe same nest (with probability r), and do not have any memory ofpreviously visited nests.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019981.g002A Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981negative infinity, therefore an ant can never become committed toit. Ants can switch between the assessment states, but we assumethat once committed to a site an ant remains so and recruits nest-mates to its preferred option; the recruitment process is not mod-elled, and the ‘committed’ states are therefore absorbing states.For the Monte-Carlo simulations, we model nest quality accep-tance thresholds in the colony as a normally distributed randomvariable A, with some mean and variance. An individual simulatedant has a quality acceptance threshold a drawn at random fromthis distribution. It discovers its next nest by sampling from aprobability distribution specified by its current nest, arena size andshape, and the proximities of other available nest sites (Table 1);part of this distribution is determined by the probability r that arandomly searching scout rediscovers the site it has just been in.On discovering a site, the scout evaluates the quality of the currentnest site with some error e added, sampled from a standard normaldistribution (mean 0; standard deviation 1); this corresponds toerror in the scout’s quality assessment. If this sampled qualityexceeds the scout’s acceptance threshold then it becomes com-mitted to the site, otherwise it continues searching (Fig. 2). Accep-tance threshold distributions and nest qualities are given arbitraryvalues (Table 1), because individual probabilities of becomingcommitted to a nest are hard to estimate empirically, due to thedifficulties in accurately identifying commitment and in eliminat-ing the effects of interactions between ants. In the model, traveltimes between sites are sampled from normal distributions. Byparameterizing this model to empirical ant movement speed andspecific experimental arenas (Table 1), we can approximate theexpected time for each simulated ant to find each nest, and thetime from first finding a nest to becoming committed to it (the antmay visit other nests in between, or visit the same nest many timesbefore committing to it). This allows us to calculate recruitmentlatencies for comparison with empirical data. In the empiricalstudies, recruitment latency concerns the time from discovering anest to first recruiting to that nest. We do not include recruitmentin the model, so modelled recruitment latency concerns the timefrom discovering a nest to ‘accepting’ that nest. For real antcolonies, searching behaviour is much reduced when quorum isachieved; we truncate the simulated data at the time at whichquorum was achieved in the real experiment, to increase com-parability (see Text S1).Model Analysis. In addition to the simulation model de-scribed in this paper, we can derive analytic results for the pro-posed rule for switching between nests. To facilitate this analysiswe simplify the Markov process slightly from that used in theMonte-Carlo simulations, by discarding the state of assessing thehome site. The four states in the simplified Markov process arethus ‘assessing poor site’, ‘assessing good site’, ‘committed to poorsite’, and ‘committed to good site’, and the state transition matrixis (with states ordered as described above from top to bottom andfrom left to right)Q~(1{p)r (1{g)(1{r) 0 0(1{p)(1{r) (1{g)r 0 0p 0 1 00 g 0 10BBB@1CCCA, ð1Þwhere p is the average per-visit probability that an ant accepts thepoor site, g is the average per-visit probability that an ant acceptsthe good site, and r is the probability that a randomly searchingscout rediscovers the site it has just been in. These are colony-wideaverage probabilities that can easily be derived from the thresholdA and error N(0,1) distributions used in the Monte-Carlosimulation, if comparability is desired. The matrix Q in eq. 1can be understood as having a column corresponding to each stateTable 1.

The probability distribution over theinitial states (‘assessing poor site’ and ‘assessing good site’) can bederived based on the relative probabilities of an arbitrary ant scoutdiscovering either when searching from the home site.Using standard techniques [e.g. 29] we derive analytic results onthe long-run behaviour of the threshold-switching rule, using thestate transition matrix Q (eq. 1) and its fundamental matrix. Ofparticular relevance to our proposals is the analysis of the expectedtime for the Markov-process to reach any absorbing state, whenstarted in some particular non-absorbing state. If we assume bothcandidate nest sites are equally likely to be discovered first from thehome site, then the expected number of steps in the Markov-chainbefore commitment to either nest site is reached is given byE(time to accept any site)~4(1{r)z2r(pzg){p{g2((2r{1)pgz(1{r)(pzg)): ð2ÞEquation (2) will be used below to examine the sensitivity ofacceptance time to changes in site qualities. Note that, technically,we should be interested in the latency between discovering aparticular site, and recruiting to that site, however in general per-state latencies are difficult to calculate in Markov-chains, and theoverall expected latency given in equation 2 is an acceptable sim-plification (see Text S1).Empirical methodsEthics statement. Our experiments on T. albipennis andcollection of colonies from the field comply with the laws of thecountry in which they were carried out and the relevant nationaland international guidelines [30,31].‘Three-New-Nests’ Experiment. Six T. albipennis colonieswere collected from the Dorset coast, England, June–July 2009.Colonies were queenright and contained 80–200 workers andbrood of all stages. Colonies were housed in artificial nests [27]and provided with water ad libitum and honey solution andDrosophila melanogaster weekly. We used these colonies to investigatedecision-making when a colony was offered a choice of three newnests. Six trials were performed, each with a new colony. One dayprior to an emigration trial, we attached an RFID micro-transponder (50065006120 mm) with a unique ID to the thoraxof every worker ant in the colony [32,33] and housed the colony ina nest formed of a hexagonal glass slide (edge length = 30 mm), a1.5 mm cardboard perimeter (cavity area 1496 mm2) and anacetate lid with a central entrance hole (1.5 mm diameter) to avoidintroducing directional bias. We performed trials in a circulararena with Fluon-coated sides, the floor of which was cleaned withwater and alcohol between trials. Three new hexagonal nests withthe same dimensions as the original nest were placed in the arena(Fig. 1c). Two nests had clear acetate lids and one had a red filtercovering the cavity area, making the nest appear relatively dark tothe ants [34]. Ant colonies choose dark over light nests [19]. Theposition of the good nest was interchanged between trials. Thenew nests had 1.5 mm wide entrances in the side facing the centreof the arena, over which RFID readers (PharmaSeq, Inc., NJ) wereplaced vertically. A trial began with the original nest placed in thecentre of the arena and then destroyed by removing the lid. TheRFID readers detected ants entering and leaving the new nests[86% tag read rate, 26] and we used handheld RFID readers toread the tags on tandem-running ants (94% tag read rate) as theycrossed half-way lines (Fig. 1c). The identity of the leader andfollower was thus recorded and the direction of the tandem runwas noted. This procedure does not disrupt tandem runs [26]. Thetime at which the transport by carrying of a nest-mate or a brooditem first occurred to each nest was recorded (i.e. the time at whichthe quorum threshold was reached). Once nest-mate transport hascommenced, the RFID system becomes less reliable [26], becausenest-mates are transported in such a way as to block the RFID tag.We therefore focused our analysis on searching and recruitment bytandem-running during the pre-quorum period. We observedemigrations until complete (old nest empty of brood and workers)and recorded the nest choice of the colony after 24 hours. Colo-nies were considered to have split if brood was present in two ormore nests.Statistical MethodsMean recruitment latencies were analysed using generalisedlinear mixed models (GLMM) ‘glmmPQL’ in the MASS library inR 2.4.1 with nest quality as a fixed factor, colony (empirical results)or replicate (simulation results) as a random factor and a Poissonerror structure. Differences between recruitment latency survivor-ship curves, were tested using generalized log-rank tests using thefunction ‘survdiff’ in the survival library in R 2.4.1. Monte Carlosimulations were carried out using MatLab 7.4.0 (see Text S1),and matrix manipulation with Maple 14.ResultsComparison with Poor Nest Near; Good Nest Far DataWe parameterized the model to the experimental set-up used byRobinson et al. [26] with a nearby poor nest and a more distantgood nest (Table 1, Fig. 1a) and performed Monte Carlo simu-lations of this experiment. The switching behaviour (ants movingfrom visiting one nest to visiting the other) in the simulations isqualitatively very similar to the empirical data (Fig. 3). In bothcases most ants that find the far (good) nest first stay at that nest,whereas ants that find the near (poor) nest first may stay or switch.The model simulations also reproduce the empirical results thatrecruitment latency does not play an important role here. In theempirical study, recruitment latency was measured as time fromdiscovering a nest to first leading a tandem run to that nest anddata are only available for ants which recruited by tandem-running. There are more recruitment latencies for the simulateddata, as all ants make a choice in the model, whereas in the realdata not all active ants perform tandem runs. This leads toquantitative differences between simulated and empirical data, butqualitatively the patterns are the same: In the simulated data, as inthe empirical data, there are no significant differences betweenrecruitment latencies to the good and poor nests (Fig. 4a, 4b).However, in a simulation presenting the two nests separately (i.e.either only old nest and near poor nest are present, or only old nestand far good nest are present) the pattern is dramatically different,with significantly higher recruitment latencies for the poor nest(Fig. 4c). This clearly demonstrates that differences in recruitmentlatency can be generated when only one nest is present, as a side-effect of the threshold rule.Comparison with Two-Equidistant-Nests DataTo test whether our model can account for the patterns seen inthe original experiments, used as evidence for the recruitmentlatency and comparison mechanisms [20], we also parameterisedthe Monte Carlo model to this experimental set-up (Fig. 1b,Table 1). Here two equidistant new nests, one good and one poor,are presented to the ant colony. The empirical data for directcomparison are shown in Table 2. Very similar results emerge inour simulations, without any memory or comparison coded intothe model (Table 2), clearly showing that this sort of behaviouralpattern can be accounted for by the threshold rule alone, withoutA Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981needing to include other mechanisms. However, the exact quan-titative results of our simulations are influenced by the acceptancethreshold and nest quality parameters. Since we do not know theshape of the real threshold distribution in an ant colony, the matchbetween simulated and empirical data here does not prove thatcomparison plays no role in ant decision-making, but does showthat results of this type do not necessarily have to be the producedby comparative evaluation.In the empirical data (Fig. 5a–f), there do appear to be quality-dependent differences in recruitment latency – however, the nestswere presented separately in these experiments. Recruitmentlatency is measured using survival analysis, treating ants that find asite but never recruit to it as censored data. Applying the sameanalysis to our simulated results demonstrates that we can repli-cate these differences in recruitment latency when the nests arepresented separately (Fig. 5g–l) but the differences disappear whenthe simulations are repeated identically, but with the nestspresented together (Fig. 5m–r). This is same pattern as wasobserved in the comparison with the the ‘poor nest near; good nestfar’ data, even though recruitment latencies are measureddifferently in the two empirical studies. These simulation resultsdemonstrate that the observed empirical differences in recruitmentFigure 3. Comparison of empirical and simulated emigration behavior.

We consider the two site case first; todo this we shall hold one of the nest site qualities constant whilevarying the other nest site quality, and examine the effect on theexpected time to reach commitment to either site. Figure 6illustrates how expected decision time varies for the one and twosite cases, for a given revisiting value of r (0.7, estimated fromempirical data). We vary the quality of the poor site (A) whilekeeping the quality of the good site (B) constant, holding g constantwhile varying p in the interval [0, 1] (see eq. 2). For a moderatequality of the constant nest (P(accept B) = g=0.88, estimated fromempirical data) expected decision time varies little between theextremes of the other nest’s quality (P(accept A) = p=0 to 1), thuswhen two nest sites are present, strong quality dependent recruit-ment latency is not evident (Fig. 6, solid line). This contrastsmarkedly with the situation where there is only one potential nestsite; this is equivalent to setting p= g in equation 2. Now a muchmore pronounced relationship between the quality of this site, andthe expected time until commitment, is evident (Fig. 6, dashedline). These analytic results agree qualitatively with results fromthe Monte-Carlo simulation (Fig. 5). This is good evidence forthe threshold rule, but does not in itself rule out sequential com-parisons since a version of the model with sequential comparisonsgives almost indistinguishable results (see Text S1, Fig. S2). How-ever, the sequential comparison model makes greater cognitivedemands on individuals, who must remember the qualities ofvisited sites and evaluate this in making subsequent comparisons.Three-New-Nests: Simulation Predictions and EmpiricalDataA total of 752 ants (across 6 colonies) were individually radio-tagged and their scouting activity was monitored during emi-gration experiments in which each colony chose between onegood and two poor nests (Fig. 1c). According to the thresholdrule, ants which independently (i.e. not by following a tandemrun) visit the good nest (A) and one of the poor nests (designatedB) and then visited another nest before quorum was reached (atwhich point carrying behaviour begins), should be equally likelyto return to good nest A or discover the other, equidistant, poornest (designated C). In contrast, if ants are using best-of-n directcomparisons, ants which have visited good nest A and then nest Bshould be more likely to return to A than to discover C.In the empirical data, 20 individuals out of the 752 wemonitored fulfilled the necessary behavioural criteria of finding Aand then B before quorum was reached. This sample size is smallbecause this behaviour was fairly rare – as would be predicted byour model, ants finding A tended to start recruiting, rather thandiscover B. Using this sample size of 20 ants for 100 simulationreplicates gives 95% confidence intervals of 7–12 ants returning toA; 8–13 ants discovering C. The empirical data fit well withinthese limits, with 11 ants returning to A and 9 discovering C. Thisdoes not differ significantly from random choice (binomial test,P=0.82). This supports the threshold hypothesis and shows noevidence that ants act on information from comparison of nests toallow them to preferentially return to a better nest.Although our data show that ants did not preferentially returnto the good nest, the comparison hypothesis could still be sup-ported if those that did return to it did so more directly becausethey had remembered its high quality. This is not the case: antsmade 0–27 (median= 3) repeat visits to B before returning to A,compared to 0–6 (median= 0) visits to B before discovering C(Mann-Whitney test: U=73, N=20, P=0.07). The trend is in theopposite direction to that predicted by the hypothesis that antsmake a comparison and act on it to return more directly to betternests. These data are consistent with threshold-based choice.A second test of whether individual ants are comparing nestsinvolves decisions to recruit nest-mates by leading a tandem-runto the new nest. If ants are using a ‘best-of-n’ comparison strategy,the sampling period before recruiting should be independent ofthe quality of the first nest they visit, whereas if ants use aninternal threshold rule, the number of nests they sample beforerecruiting should be strongly dependent on the quality of the firstnest they visit, with ants that find the high quality nest first beinglikely to initiate recruitment to this nest immediately. In theempirical data, 13 individual ants initiated recruitment by leadinga tandem run, of which 8 had discovered the good nest first, and 5had discovered a poor nest first. Using these sample sizes for 100simulation replicates predicts that ants finding the good nest firstshould not visit any other nest before recruiting (median totalnests visited: 95%CI 1-1) whereas ants finding the poor nest firstshould be more likely to visit other nests before recruiting (mediantotal nests visited 95%CI 1-2). The empirical data fit thesepredictions. Ants which found the good nest first visited a medianof only that 1 nest before recruiting, whereas those which foundthe poor nest visited a median of 2 different nests before leading atandem run (Mann-Whitney test, U=36, N=13, P,0.05). Thedata do not support the recruitment latency mechanism, as thereare no quality-dependent differences in time from nest discov-ery to recruitment by tandem-running (good nest: mean 6SD= 20619 min; poor nest: mean 6 SD=28624 min; t-test:t12=0.71, P=0.49).DiscussionOur results show that a very simple individual mechanism canproduce effective collective decision-making. The predictions ofour threshold decision-making model correspond well withempirical data from house-hunting ants. Our simulations of theTable 2.

This explanationof empirical data is supported by our analytical modelling results.Our results clearly support the hypothesis that this simple par-simonious mechanism (the threshold rule) is sufficient to reproduceobserved empirical patterns of collective decision-making: ourresults can account for both apparent direct comparison of nestquality and for apparent quality-dependent recruitment latency,which had been previously proposed as mechanisms of collectivechoice. Our parsimonious threshold model is sufficient to explainthe data without assuming more complex behavioural mecha-nisms. This highlights the need for carefully designed experimentsto determine whether or not individuals make comparisons, anddemonstrates that group-level comparison behaviour does notnecessarily imply individual-level comparison behaviour. In thecase of ants, evidence of the ability of lone individuals to makedirect comparisons of alternatives has only recently been published[25]; as our results show, previously published studies were notsufficient to demonstrate this. Further empirical investigation isrequired to establish what role, if any, direct comparison by in-dividual ants plays in the collective decision-process.We can subdivide comparison behaviour into two types thatcan aid decision-making: best-of-n comparisons and sequentialcomparisons. Best-of-n comparison mechanisms are characterisedby a sampling period, and preferential return to the best option[35]. We conducted a multiple-nest experiment to test directly ifreal ants show these behaviours. Neither is observed. In contrast,the results support the threshold model: if the first nest theyencountered was of a high quality, the ants started recruitmentimmediately without continuing to sample, and those ants whichhad the opportunity to compare nests did not act on this infor-mation by preferential or more direct return to better nests.Sequential comparisons occur when each time an animal en-counters a new option, it compares the new option to its memoryof previously encountered options and is more likely to accept thenew one if it compares favourably. This is similar to the thresholdmodel, but thresholds are influenced by experience. In one variantof this, individuals sample several options and then accept the nextoption they encounter which exceeds the quality of all previousoptions. This strategy can be shown to provide the optimalsolution to the ‘secretary problem’; a sequential search problem inwhich previously encountered options are subsequently unavail-able [36]. We modelled a sequential comparison mechanism (seeText S1) to compare with our threshold model. The results showthat this type of comparison model predicts similar recruitmentlatency results to our threshold model. We therefore cannot ruleout this sequential comparison mechanism, but note that it is a lessparsimonious solution. Our threshold model is sufficient to explainthe data without invoking memory and comparison during thedecision process.Our simulated ants have no memory of previously visited nests,and yet behaviour previously described as ‘comparison’ stillemerges in our simulations (Table 2). This clearly shows thatempirical data of this sort cannot be used as evidence that ananimal is really remembering and comparing. The decisionprocess we propose is ‘memoryless’ in the sense that individualants do not have to remember previously visited alternativesduring their search for an acceptable nest. Our model deals onlywith the decision process up to the point at which an ant accepts anest. After that point, real ants clearly do use memory of nestlocation in order to recruit nest-mates to that nest by tandem-running [20]. Recruitment is the most easily identifiable actionindicating commitment, but ants that have accepted a nest mayalso act on their commitment by making repeat visits to the nest[26,37]. By making repeat visits, ants are able to assess nest areamore accurately [37] and would also contribute to the accumu-lation of a quorum at their chosen nest, causing the switch to rapidnest-mate carrying behaviour [18]. Memory is therefore animportant part of the implementation of the decision, but antsfollowing the threshold rule do not need to invest in rememberingthe qualities or locations of multiple nests during the decision-making process.Figure 6. Analytical results of Markov Chain model. Expectedtime for an ant to accept any site across varying qualities of site A,calculated from equation 2. Dashed line: only site A present. Solid line:two nests present; site B fixed at P(accept nest B) = 0.88 (estimated fromdata, see Text S1, Fig. S1). For two nests present, either site is equallylikely to be discovered first. Nest rediscovery probability r= 0.7(estimated from data, see Text S1, Table S1). The reduced effect ofsite A’s quality on expected decision time is robust to variations in siteB’s quality, except where this becomes low (see Fig. S1).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019981.g006Figure 5.

The initial advantage is amplified by recruitment, and thiscan be shown to be sufficient to account for collective choice [24].In both the threshold rule and the recruitment latency hypothesis,a scout makes a probabilistic, quality-dependent decision aboutwhether to recruit each time she visits a nest. The differencebetween these mechanisms come from the assumptions madeabout what the scout does after leaving the nest, and how thisresults in a colony decision-mechanism. In our threshold rule, theant either commits or continues searching. In the recruitmentlatency hypothesis, ants which do not immediately start recruitingmay subsequently recruit, with a quality-dependent latency. In theoriginal formulation of this idea [20] it is mentioned that antsmight discover other nests during this latent period, but it is notsuggested that the latency is actually a result of the search for othernests. Searching for alternatives has a more prominent role in laterversions of the recruitment latency model [24] making it moresimilar to our threshold model, however, the idea of simplequality-dependent recruitment latencies functioning as a choicemechanism still appears often in discussions of collective decision-making [11,38,39]. There are two empirical problems with such amechanism. Firstly, colonies are able to choose a good nest, evenwhen it is so much further away than a poor nest that travel timeshould cancel out differences in recruitment latency [27]. Sec-ondly, all empirical evidence for quality-dependent recruitmentlatencies comes from studies offering a colony just one new nest[20,22,24,28]. When recruitment latencies are measured inmultiple nest experiments, no quality-dependent recruitmentlatencies differences are observed [this study and 26]. We usedmodelling to investigate these empirical results. Our simulationand analytical results reproduce quality-dependent recruitmentlatency in a single-nest experiment, but show that the presence ofan extra nest disrupts the quality-dependence of the latency tocommitment and recruitment (Figs. 5–6). When a single poor nestis offered, acceptance times in the model will be geometricallydistributed, with few ants accepting the site early due to rareassessment errors or low individual-thresholds, and the remaindercontinuing to re-assess the same site until they eventually decide itis good enough. When a second higher quality site is introduced,the same small proportion of ants will accept the poor site earlydue to low-threshold or assessment error, but the remainder willnow tend to discover the alternative, superior site, and recruitto this quickly on average because of its increased quality. Thesame pattern would be observed for a threshold-rule with directcomparison (see Text S1), and also for a quality-dependent re-cruitment latency-rule, if it is assumed that ants search foralternatives during the latency period and have a high probabilityof finding other sites [20]. However, these alternative models areless parsimonious, requiring ants to remember the qualities and/orlocations of visited sites and evaluate this in making subsequentcomparisons or use the information to decide when and where tostart recruiting. These results also clearly demonstrate that aphenomenon observed when only one option is available, cannotbe assumed to function in the same way when choosing betweenmultiple options (see also [7]).Another well-studied example of collective decision-making isnest-site choice by swarming honeybees (Apis mellifera). Like antcolonies, bee swarms are able to choose between different nestsites, and individual bees do not need to have visited multiple sitesfor the swarm to be able to choose between them [40]. However,the way the scouts act on this information differs between the twogroups. The ants seem to use a binary decision process to eitheraccept that nest or continue searching. Ants accepting a nestrecruit others, causing a positive feedback process, but ant scoutsdo not modulate their recruitment according to nest quality, e.g.by recruiting at a faster rate or for longer to a higher quality nest[20,26]. In contrast, bees use a graded process, whereby scoutsinitially discovering a new nest-site almost always recruit [41],but the duration and rate of the recruiting waggle-dances aredependent on nest quality [42]. This means that more recruits arebrought to better nest-sites, leading to a positive feedback processusually resulting in a unanimous choice of the better site [42]. Onepossible reason for this difference in strategy could be differencesin nest availability: if suitable honeybee nest sites are relativelyrare, then it might be better for scouts to avoid ever rejecting apotential nest outright.Collective decisions are also made in other contexts, such aschoice of foraging site. Here again, comparisons of sites by indi-viduals seems to play little role. Foraging honeybees do not com-pare food sources [43], nor do they compare the waggle-dances ofrecruiters at the hive [44]. Rather, multiple sites ‘compete’ forforagers, with bees foraging more persistently at high quality sitesand recruiting to them more energetically [43,45]. Foragers canalso directly inhibit recruitment if they perceive danger at a par-ticular food source by the use of ‘stop-signals’ directed at beesrecruiting to that source [46]. In trail-laying ants and bees,pheromone trails to better foraging sites are more stronglyreinforced and this again leads to a collective choice without anynecessity for individuals to visit multiple sites [47,48]. Just as fornest-site choice, foraging recruitment can either be graded (layingmore pheromone to a better food source, e.g. [47,49]) or a binarydecision (all-or-nothing recruitment, e.g. [50,51]).Direct comparison of alternatives is seen in a range of animalsand contexts, including foraging in scrub jays and humans [8,52],mate choice in bower-birds and dance-flies [53,54] and shellassessment by hermit crabs [55]. A best-of-n comparison strategywould maximise decision accuracy [2], so why do neither indi-vidual bees nor ants appear to use this strategy when foraging orchoosing a new home? One possibility is that multiple comparisonsare too cognitively complex for ant and bee brains. However,small insects including bees are competent at related cognitiveprocesses, including contextual learning, discrimination betweenstimuli and associative recall [56]. Male dance-flies compare thesize of potential mates before choosing [54], and there is evidenceto suggest that honeybee workers are capable of comparativeevaluation of flowers [57] and that lone T. rugatulus ant workers arecapable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are veryclose together [25]. There may, therefore, be reasons other thancognitive constraints for why relying on individual best-of-ncomparisons to inform collective choices does not appear to haveevolved as a decision mechanism in bees or ants. One possiblereason is that during their evolutionary history the ants havetypically been faced with decisions about whether to accept asingle option at a time, rather than simultaneously having in-formation about multiple options, and this has shaped theevolution of their decision process [7]. Another possible reason isthe potential speed advantage of avoiding a sampling period.Sampling periods can be costly [2,7] and pose the mathematicallycomplex problem of deciding how long to sample for beforestarting the decision process [58]. Avoiding best-of-n comparisonsallows a potentially vulnerable colony to select the first nestencountered, if it is good enough. Perhaps even more important isdistributing the decision-making process, relying less on informa-tion-processing by a single individual; rather allowing the decisionA Threshold Rule for Collective DecisionsPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19981to emerge from a collective process to which even partly-informedindividuals can contribute. In this colony-level cognition, therelevant information about the environment is represented withinthe individuals in a colony, their actions and interactions. At thecollective level this generates new information: which nest thecolony should choose [59]. In both bees and ants, the informationheld by individuals is integrated into a colony choice by means of aquorum threshold, which triggers rapid implementation of thedecision [18,60]. Although the colony will usually choose the sitewhich reaches quorum first, this does not mean that the colony asa whole must ‘satisfice’, accepting the first nest surpassing someminimum standard. Using quality-dependent initiation (in Tem-nothorax ants) or modulation (in honeybees) of the recruitmentprocess leading to the attainment of a quorum, the colony in effectcarries out a concurrent but indirect collective comparison process,which may implement optimal decision-making through theactions of partly-informed individuals [61]. This ensures that thenest to reach a quorum first is also likely to be the best option, evenwhen there is an array of possible alternatives [16,42]. Thuswithout the individuals using a ‘best-of-n’ comparison strategy, thecolony is able to solve a ‘best-of-n’ challenge [16,62].A further possible advantage of avoiding individual directcomparisons is that it would remove the risk of ‘irrational’ decisionbehaviour at the individual level [26], associated with comparative,relative evaluation of options such as best-of-n, or sequentialcomparisons. Individuals following our proposed threshold rulemake an absolute evaluation of quality, and this evaluation of oneoption is not influenced by the other alternatives available, incontrast to the context-dependent decision-making used by manyother animals including humans [8,63,64]. Although at thecollective level, a comparison between options is effectively beingmade, a non-comparative individual-level mechanism for thisdecision could protect the colony from irrationality in decision-making. For example, emigrating T. albipennis colonies followrational transitivity patterns in decision making [16] and in therelated species T. curvispinosus and T. rugatulus, colonies seem to beimmune to irrational distractor effects from irrelevant alternatives[25,65]. Although work on T. rugatulus suggests that this collectiveimmunity can emerge even if individuals are susceptible todistractor effects provided their individual contribution to thecollective decision is small [25], our work suggests this collectiverationality can emerge without depending on low numbers of antsvisiting both nests – if individual ants follow the threshold rule, thenthe colony can escape these irrational comparison behaviours.Using an absolute evaluation method does have a potentialdrawback, if the acceptance threshold is not appropriate to theenvironment. When used in individual decision making (e.g.during mate choice in cockroaches, [9]) the success of this sort ofsequential search strategy will be highly sensitive to the thresholdused. For example, if all available options are poor quality, ananimal may reject them all, and end up worse off than if it hadaccepted a poor option. In contrast, when this strategy is used forgroup decision making, variation in acceptance thresholds acrossthe group provides protection against this sensitivity. If all optionsare poor quality, some low-threshold individuals will still acceptone, allowing the group to make a choice. Similarly, intra-colonyvariation in task response thresholds promotes effective division oflabour in social insect colonies, with more individuals engaging ina particular task when the stimulus for that task increases [66–68].Our model assumes that individual thresholds are fixed over thetime-scale of the emigration process, however further flexibilitywould be available if acceptance thresholds were updated based onexperience over the course of an individual’s life-time [69,70].Flexible task thresholds promote flexible division of labour in socialinsect colonies [71–73]. How much acceptance threshold variationactually occurs within a colony, and whether ant acceptancethresholds are fixed throughout life or changed by experience, areissues remaining to be explored.In summary, our simple individual-threshold model is sufficientto explain empirical decision-making data, without assuming morecomplex behavioural mechanisms. Since the scientific methodgives preference to the more parsimonious model, this result showsthat care is needed in inferring individual behaviour from groupbehaviour. We propose that, in general, individual decision-makers can use this simple threshold rule to provide their groupwith an elegant solution to the problem of making a collectivechoice. This strategy allows the group to make a rational, well-informed and rapid decision.Supporting InformationFigure S1 ‘Expected decision time in a two-nest scenario.Expected time for an ant to accept any site across varying qualities(probabilities of acceptance) of sites A and B, calculated fromequation 2.(TIF)Figure S2 ‘Expected decision time in one-nest scenario.Expected time for an ant to accept any site, using the parametersof Figure 6, for the no-comparison threshold-rule of the main text(red), and for the direct-comparison threshold-rule describedabove (green).(TIF)Text S1 This supplementary model information coversdetails of model parameterisation for the analytical andsimulation modelling.

       " 'abstract': \"Decision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler, faster strategies to find a 'good enough' option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behaviours including foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study of a collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decision strategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possible decision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simple rule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can account parsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when available nests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. We present empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individual sequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able to effectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. This parsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making\",\n",

They owe their\\nbrightness to the dense confined plasma, and this review focuses on loops mostly as structures\\nconfining plasma. After a brief historical overview, the review is divided into two separate but\\nnot independent parts: the first illustrates the observational framework, the second reviews\\nthe theoretical knowledge. Quiescent loops and their confined plasma are considered and,\\ntherefore, topics such as loop oscillations and flaring loops (except for non-solar ones, which\\nprovide information on stellar loops) are not specifically addressed here. The observational\\nsection discusses the classification, populations, and the morphology of coronal loops, its\\nrelationship with the magnetic field, and the loop stranded structure. The section continues\\nwith the thermal properties and diagnostics of the loop plasma, according to the classification\\ninto hot, warm, and cool loops. Then, temporal analyses of loops and the observations of\\nplasma dynamics, hot and cool flows, and waves are illustrated. In the modeling section, some\\nbasics of loop physics are provided, supplying fundamental scaling laws and timescales, a useful\\ntool for consultation. The concept of loop modeling is introduced and models are divided into\\nthose treating loops as monolithic and static, and those resolving loops into thin and dynamic\\nstrands. More specific discussions address modeling the loop fine structure and the plasma\\nflowing along the loops. Special attention is devoted to the question of loop heating, with\\nseparate discussion of wave (AC) and impulsive (DC) heating. Large-scale models including\\natmosphere boxes and the magnetic field are also discussed. Finally, a brief discussion about\\nstellar coronal loops is followed by highlights and open questions.\\nKeywords: Coronal loops, Corona\\nThis review is licensed under a Creative Commons\\nAttribution-Non-Commercial 3.0 Germany License.\\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/de/\\nImprint / Terms of Use\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics is a peer reviewed open access journal published by the Max\\nPlanck Institute for Solar System Research, Justus-von-Liebig-Weg 3, 37077 Go¨ttingen, Germany.\\nISSN 1614-4961.\\nThis review is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial 3.0 Germany\\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/de/.

Its name derives from the fact that, since it is\\nextremely tenuous with respect to the lower atmosphere, it is visible in the optical band only during\\nthe solar eclipses as a faint crown (corona in Latin) around the black moon disk. When inspected\\nthrough spectroscopy the corona reveals unexpected emission lines, which were first identified as\\ndue to a new element (coronium), but which were later ascertained to be due to high excitation\\nstates of iron (Grotrian, 1939; Edle´n, 1943). It became then clear that the corona is made of\\nvery high temperature gas, hotter than 1 MK. Almost all the gas is fully ionized there and thus\\ninteracts effectively with the ambient magnetic field. It is for this reason that the corona appears\\nso inhomogeneous when observed in the X-ray band, in which plasma at million degrees emits most\\nof its radiation. In particular, the plasma is confined inside magnetic flux tubes that are anchored\\non both sides to the underlying photosphere. When the confined plasma is heated more than the\\nsurroundings, its pressure and density increase. Since the tenuous plasma is optically thin, the\\nintensity of its radiation is proportional to the square of the density, and the tube becomes much\\nbrighter than the surrounding ones and looks like a bright closed arch: a coronal loop.\\nWhen observed in the X-ray band, the bright corona appears to be made entirely by coronal\\nloops that can, therefore, be considered as the building blocks of X-ray bright corona. This review\\nspecifically addresses coronal loops as bright structures confining plasma. It first provides an\\nobservational framework that is the basis for the second part of the review dealing with modeling\\nand interpretation.\\nThe observational section (3) discusses loop classification and populations, and then describes\\nthe morphology of coronal loops, its relationship with the magnetic field, regarding the shape and\\ncross-section, and the concept of loops as consisting of bundles of strands, whose thickness may go\\ndown to sub-arcsecond scale. The following part of this section is devoted to the characteristics\\nof the loop plasma and of its thermal structure. Diagnostics of the emission measure and of its\\ntemperature distribution retrieved from filter ratios and spectroscopy are introduced. The thermal\\nproperties of the loops are discussed according to a broad classification into hot, warm, and cool\\nloops. Hot loops are best observed in the soft X-rays and in active regions, and attention is\\ndevoted to the possible presence of minor very hot components out of flares. Warm loops are\\nthose better observed in several EUV bands with lines emitted around 1 MK and often found to\\nbe more isothermal and dense than expected, probably because they are out of equilibrium. The\\nemission measure distribution of loops in the whole coronal temperature range is reviewed paying\\nattention to its shape and broadness, that may indicate or not the coexistence of many heating-\\ncooling cycles. Then, temporal analyses of loop light curves focus on searching for variability in\\ndifferent bands that may indicate a highly variable or more steady heating, and the characteristic\\ntimescales. The observations show more and more evidence for significant plasma dynamics and\\nflows, from subsonic to supersonic. Widespread patterns of redshifts and blueshifts are found in\\ndifferent temperature regimes and their spatial distribution is also discussed. Evidence for upflows\\nfrom the chromosphere and of possible coronal counterparts is addressed. Observations reporting\\non the detection of waves propagating along loops are also mentioned.\\nIn the modeling section (4) some basics of loop physics are provided, supplying some funda-\\nmental scaling laws and timescales, a useful tool for consultation. The concept of loop modeling\\nis introduced and models are distinguished between those treating loops as monolithic and static,\\nand those resolving loops into thin and dynamic strands. Then, more specific discussions address\\nhow modeling the loop fine structure is able to explain observed evidence for deviations from equi-\\nlibrium and different filling factors in different bands, and can help investigating the concept of\\nrandomly-distributed heat pulses. Models also address plasma flowing along the loops, both as\\nsiphon flows and as motions driven by dynamic heating, i.e., hot upflows from the chromosphere\\nfirst and downflows from draining afterwards. Special attention is devoted to the question of loop\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n6 Fabio Reale\\nheating, which is strictly connected to the general problem of coronal heating. The conversion\\nof magnetic energy into heat and the problem of the difficult diagnostics of the heating are first\\ndiscussed in general terms. Impulsive (DC) and wave (AC) heating are separately discussed. DC\\nmodels have extensively investigated the heating by nanoflares searching for possible signatures\\nand properties such as their frequency and location. AC heating models focus on the way to dissi-\\npate waves and to match the observational scenario. Some discussion is devoted to MHD models\\nthat describe the solar atmosphere from the chromosphere to the corona on a larger area, and\\nincluding the magnetic field and the radiative transfer, and to models that describe the magnetic\\nfield dissipation through turbulent cascades to very small scales.\\nThere have been several earlier books (Bray et al., 1991; Golub and Pasachoff, 1997, 2001;\\nAschwanden, 2004) and reviews (Vaiana and Rosner, 1978; Peres and Vaiana, 1990; Golub, 1996;\\nAschwanden et al., 2001; Reale, 2005), in particular on coronal heating (Zirker, 1993; Cargill, 1995;\\nKlimchuk, 2006; De Moortel and Nakariakov, 2012; Parnell and De Moortel, 2012), that have in\\ngeneral a larger or different scope but include information about coronal loops. Interested readers\\nare urged to survey these other reviews in order to complement and fill in any gaps in topical\\ncoverage of the present paper.\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 7\\n2 Historical Keynotes\\nFirst evidence of magnetic confinement came from rocket missions in the 1960s. In particular, in\\n1965, arcmin angular resolution was achieved with grazing incidence optics (Giacconi et al., 1965).\\nThe data analysis led to the first density and temperature diagnostics with wide band filters,\\nto derive high pressure in compact regions with intense bipolar magnetic fields and to propose\\nthe magnetic confinement (Reidy et al., 1968). The first coronal loop structures were identified\\nproperly after a rocket launch in 1968, which provided for the first time an image of an X-ray flare\\n(Vaiana et al., 1968), with a resolution of a few arcsec.\\nIn the course of collecting the results of all rocket missions of the American Science and En-\\ngineering (AS&E) program, Vaiana et al. (1973) proposed a classification of the morphology of\\nthe X-ray corona as fundamentally consisting of arch-like structures connecting regions of opposite\\nmagnetic polarity in the photosphere. The classification was based on the loop size, and on the\\nphysical conditions of the confined plasma, on the underlying photospheric regions. They dis-\\ntinguished active regions, coronal holes, active regions interconnection, filament cavities, bright\\npoints, and large-scale structures (Vaiana and Rosner, 1978; Peres and Vaiana, 1990).\\nThe magnetic structuring of the solar corona is evident. However, the magnetic field lines\\ncan be traced only indirectly because direct measurements are feasible generally only low in the\\nphotosphere through the Zeeman effect on spectral lines. It is anyhow possible to extrapolate the\\nmagnetic field in a volume. This was done to derive the magnetic field structure of a relatively\\nstable active region by Poletto et al. (1975) using the Schmidt (1964) method, under the assumption\\nof negligible currents in the corona. This was also useful to derive magnetic field intensities\\nsufficient for hot plasma confinement. Later on, even more reliable magnetic field topologies were\\nderived assuming force-free fields (e.g., Sakurai, 1981), i.e., with currents everywhere parallel to the\\nmagnetic field as it is expected in coronal loops. However, the agreement of force-free magnetic field\\nextrapolation with the details of the observed coronal EUV topology is often far from satisfactory\\n(e.g., Wiegelmann et al., 2006).\\nThe rocket missions lacked good time coverage and the information about the evolution of\\ncoronal loops was only limited, mostly available from the Orbiting Solar Observatory-IV (OSO-\\nIV) mission (Krieger et al., 1972). This satellite had an angular resolution in the order of the\\narcmin and could not resolve individual loops. In 1973, the X-ray telescope S-054 on-board Skylab\\nmonitored the evolution of coronal loops for several months, taking 32 000 X-ray photographs with\\na maximum resolution of 2 arcsec and an extended dynamic range. It was possible to study the\\nwhole evolution of an active region, from the emergence as compact loops filled with dense plasma\\nto its late spreading, a few solar rotations later, as progressively longer and longer loops filled with\\nless and less dense plasma (Golub et al., 1982). It was confirmed that the whole X-ray bright\\ncorona consists of magnetic loops, whose lifetime is typically much longer than the characteristic\\ncooling times (Rosner et al., 1978). This applies also to coronal holes where the magnetic field\\nopens radially to the interplanetary space and the plasma streams outwards with practically no\\nX-ray emission.\\nIn the same mission coronal loops were also detected in the UV band at temperatures below\\n1 MK, by Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) telescopes S-055 (Reeves et al., 1977) and S-082 (Tou-\\nsey et al., 1977; Bartoe et al., 1977). These loops are invisible in the X-ray band and many of\\nthem depart from sunspots, appear coaxial and are progressively thinner for progressively lower\\ntemperature ions (Foukal, 1975, 1976). The apparent scale height of the emission is larger than\\nthat expected from a static model, but the loops appear to be steady for long times. Foukal\\n(1976) proposed a few explanations including siphon flows and thermal instability of the plasma\\nat the loop apex. New observations of such cool loops were performed several years later with the\\nSolar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) mission and provided new details and confirmations\\n(Section 3.5).\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n8 Fabio Reale\\nA different target was addressed by the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM, 1980 – 1989, Bohlin\\net al., 1980; Acton et al., 1980), which included high-resolution spectrometers in several X-ray lines,\\ni.e., the Bent Crystal Spectrometer (BCS) and the Flat Crystal Spectrometer (FCS), mostly de-\\nvoted to obtain time-resolved spectroscopy of coronal flares (e.g., MacNeice et al., 1985). Similarly,\\nthe Hinotori mission (1981 – 1991, Tanaka, 1983) was dedicated mainly to solar flare observations\\nin the X-ray band. This was also the scope of the later Yohkoh mission, (1991 – 2001, Ogawara\\net al., 1991) by means of high resolution X-ray spectroscopy, adding the monitoring and imaging\\nof the hot and flaring corona. Hara et al. (1992) found first indications of plasma at 5 – 6 MK in\\nactive regions with the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT, Tsuneta et al., 1991).\\nNormal-incidence optics were developed in the late 1980s. An early experiment was the Normal\\nIncidence X-ray Telescope (NIXT, Golub and Herant, 1989), which provided a few high resolution\\ncoronal images in the EUV band.\\nLater space missions dedicated to study the corona have been the Solar and Heliospheric Ob-\\nservatory (SoHO, Domingo et al., 1995), launched in 1995 and still operative, and the Transition\\nRegion and Coronal Explorer (TRACE, Handy et al., 1999), launched in 1998 and replaced in 2010\\nby the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) instruments. Both SoHO and TRACE were tailored\\nto observe the quiet corona (below 2 MK). SoHO images the whole corona (Extreme ultraviolet\\nImaging Telescope, EIT, Delaboudinie`re et al., 1995) and performs wide band spectroscopy (Solar\\nUltraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation, SUMER, Wilhelm et al., 1995) and (Coronal Di-\\nagnostic Spectrometer, CDS, Harrison et al., 1995) in the EUV band; TRACE imaged the EUV\\ncorona with high spatial (0.5 arcsec) and temporal (30 s) resolution. Both SoHO/EIT and TRACE\\nare based on normal-incidence optics and contain three different EUV filters that provide limited\\nthermal diagnostics.\\nThanks to their capabilities, both missions allowed to address finer diagnostics, in particular\\nto investigate the fine transverse structuring of coronal loops, both in its geometric and thermal\\ncomponents, and the plasma dynamics and the heating mechanisms at a higher level of detail.\\nSoHO and TRACE have been complementary in many respects and several studies attempted to\\ncouple the information from them.\\nAmong other relevant missions, we mention the CORONAS series (Ignatiev et al., 1998; Oraevsky\\nand Sobelman, 2002), with instruments like SPectroheliographIc X-Ray Imaging Telescope (SPIRIT,\\nZhitnik et al., 2003), REntgenovsky Spektrometr s Izognutymi Kristalami (ReSIK, Sylwester et al.,\\n1998), and Solar Photometer in X-rays (SPHINX, Sylwester et al., 2008; Gburek et al., 2013), which\\nhave contributed to the investigation of coronal loops.\\nIn late 2006, two other major solar missions started, namely Hinode (Kosugi et al., 2007)\\nand the Solar TErrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO, e.g., Kaiser et al., 2008). On-board\\nHinode, two instruments address particularly the study of coronal loops: the X-Ray Telescope\\n(XRT, Golub et al., 2007) and the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS, Culhane et al.,\\n2007). Both these instruments offer considerable improvements on previous missions. The XRT\\nhas a spatial resolution of about 1 arcsec, a very low scattering and the possibility to switch among\\nnine filters and combinations of them. EIS combines well spectral (∼ 2 mA), spatial (2''), and\\ntemporal (∼ 10 s) resolution to obtain accurate diagnostics of plasma dynamics and density. One\\nbig achievement of the STEREO mission is that, since it consists of two separate spacecrafts getting\\nfarther and farther from each other, it allows – through, for instance, its Sun-Earth Connection\\nCoronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) package – a first 3D reconstruction of coronal\\nloops (Aschwanden et al., 2009; Kramar et al., 2009).\\nIn 2010, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell et al., 2012) mission has been launched\\nwith three instruments on-board: Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al., 2012;\\nBoerner et al., 2012), EUV Variability Experiment (EVE, Woods et al., 2012), and Helioseismic\\nand Magnetic Imager (HMI, Scherrer et al., 2012). SDO observations lead to big improvements\\nin the study of coronal-loop physics, basically because it monitors the full Sun continuously with\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 9\\nhigh temporal and spatial resolution, especially with the AIA EUV normal-incidence telescope\\nat 9 different UV and EUV channels. It is worthwhile mentioning also the sounding rocket mis-\\nsion High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C, Cirtain et al., 2013), which achieved an unprecedented\\nspatial resolution (0.2'') in the EUV band (195 A˚).\\n3 The Observational Framework\\n3.1 General properties\\nAlthough coronal loops are often well defined and studied in the EUV band, detected by many\\nspace mission spectrometers like those on board SoHO and Hinode, and by high resolution imagers\\nsuch as TRACE and SDO/AIA, the bulk of coronal loops is visible in the X-ray band (Figure 1).\\nAlso, the peak of the coronal emission measure of active regions – where the loops are brightest\\n– is above 2 MK, which is best observed in X-rays (e.g., Peres et al., 2000; Reale et al., 2009a;\\nWarren et al., 2011).\\nCoronal loops are characterized by an arch-like shape that recalls typical magnetic field topol-\\nogy. This shape is replicated over a wide range of dimensions. Referring, for the moment, to the\\nsoft X-ray band, the main properties of coronal loops are listed in Table 1. The length of coronal\\nloops spans more than two orders of magnitude. As already mentioned, the loops owe their high\\nluminosity and variety to their nature of magnetic flux tubes where the plasma is confined and\\nisolated from the surroundings. Magnetized fully-ionized plasma conducts thermal energy mostly\\nalong the magnetic field lines. Due to the high thermal insulation, coronal loops can have different\\ntemperatures, from ∼ 105 K up to a few ∼ 107 K (flaring loops). A density of the confined plasma\\nbelow 107 – 108 cm−3 can be difficult to detect, while the density can grow up to 1012 cm−3 in\\nflaring loops. The corresponding plasma pressure in non-flaring loops can typically vary between\\n10−3 and 10 dyne cm−2, corresponding to confining magnetic fields 𝐵 ∼ 8𝜋𝑝0.5 of the order of\\n0.1 – 10 G in the corona. One characterizing feature of coronal loops is that typically their cross-\\nsection is constant along their length above the transition region, at variance from the topology\\nof potential magnetic fields. There is evidence that the cross-section varies across the transition\\nregion, as documented in Gabriel (1976). A simple geometric description is reported in Chae et al.\\n(1998c):\\n𝐴(𝑇 )/𝐴(𝑇ℎ) = [1 + (Λ\\n2 − 1)(𝑇/𝑇ℎ)𝜈 ]1/2/Λ , (1)\\nwhere 𝐴 is the cross-section area, 𝑇 is the temperature, 𝑇ℎ = 10\\n6 K, Λ = 30, and 𝜈 = 3.6.\\nTable 1: Typical X-ray coronal loop parameters\\nType Length Temperature Density Pressure\\n[109 cm] [MK] [109 cm–3] [dyne cm–2]\\nBright points 0.1 – 1 2 5 3\\nActive region 1 – 10 3 1 – 10 1 – 10\\nGiant arches 10 – 100 1 – 2 0.1 – 1 0.1\\nFlaring loops 1 – 10 > 10 > 50 > 100\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n10 Fabio Reale\\n0 100 200 300 400 500\\nX (pixels)\\n0\\n100\\n200\\n300\\n400\\n500\\nY \\n(pi\\nxe\\nls)\\n \\n \\n0 100 200 300 400 500\\nX (pixels)\\n0\\n100\\n200\\n300\\n400\\n500\\nY \\n(pi\\nxe\\nls)\\n \\n \\nFigure 1: Images of the same active region, taken in the EUV band with TRACE (top) and in the X-ray\\nband with Hinode/XRT (bottom), on 14 November 2006.

Attempts to\\ndefine and classify coronal loops were never easy, and no finally established result exists to-date.\\nEarly attempts were based on morphological criteria, i.e., bright points, active-region loops, and\\nlarge-scale structures (Vaiana et al., 1973, Figure 2), largely observed with instruments in the\\nX-ray band. In addition to such classification, more recently, the observation of loops in different\\nspectral bands and the suspicion that the difference lies not only in the band, but also in intrinsic\\nproperties, have stimulated another classification based on the temperature regime, i.e., cool, warm,\\nhot loops (Table 2). Cool loops are generally detected in UV lines at temperatures between 105 and\\n106 K. They were first addressed by Foukal (1976) and later explored more with SoHO observations\\n(Brekke et al., 1997). Warm loops are well observed by EUV imagers such as SoHO/EIT, TRACE,\\nand in most channels of SDO/AIA, and confine plasma at temperature around 1 – 1.5 MK (Lenz\\net al., 1999). Hot loops are those typically observed in the X-ray band, and in hot UV and EUV\\nlines (e.g., Fexvi) and channels (SDO/AIA 335 A˚), with temperatures around or above 2 MK\\n(Table 1). These are the coronal loops already identified, for instance, in the early rocket missions\\n(Vaiana et al., 1973). This distinction is not only due to observation with different instruments and\\nin different bands, but there are hints that it may be more substantial and physical, i.e., there may\\nbe two or more classes of loops that may be governed by different regimes of physical processes. For\\ninstance, the temperature along warm loops appears to be distributed uniformly and the density\\nto be higher than that predicted by equilibrium conditions. Does this make such loops intrinsically\\ndifferent from hot loops, or is it just the signature that warm loops are a transient conditions\\nof hot loops? New state-of-art methods, like differential emission measure tomography (DEMT),\\nhave proposed a new classification of coronal loops based on whether the temperature increases or\\ndecreases with height (Huang et al., 2012).\\nTable 2: Thermal coronal loop classification\\nType Temperature [MK]\\nCool 0.1 – 1\\nWarm 1 – 1.5\\nHot ≥ 2\\nA real progress in the insight into coronal loops is expected from the study of large samples\\nof loops or of loop populations. Systematic studies of coronal loops suffer from the problem of\\nthe sample selection and loop identification, because, for instance, loops in active regions overlap\\nalong the line sight. Attempts of systematic studies have been performed in the past on Yohkoh\\nand TRACE data (e.g., Porter and Klimchuk, 1995; Aschwanden et al., 2000). A large number\\nof loops were analyzed and it was possible to obtain meaningful statistics. However, it is difficult\\nto generalize the results because of limited samples and/or selection effects, e.g., best observed\\nloops, specific instrument. One basic problem for statistical studies of coronal loops is that it\\nis very difficult to define an objective criterion for loop identification. In fact, loops are rarely\\nisolated; they coexist with other loops that intersect or even overlap along the line of sight. This is\\nespecially true in active regions where most of the loops are found. In order to make a real progress\\nalong this line, we should obtain loop samples and populations selected on totally objective and\\nunbiased criteria, which is difficult due to the problems outlined above. Some steps are coming in\\nthis direction (Aschwanden et al., 2013) and we will see results in the future.\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n12 Fabio Reale\\n\\x03\\x05\\x01\\n\\x02\\x06\\x01\\n\\x04\\x07\\x07\\x01\\n\\x0b\\n\\x0b\\n\\x01\\x08\\t\\x01\\nFigure 2: The X-ray corona contains loops with different spatial scales, e.g., bright points (BP), active\\nregion loops (AR), large-scale structures (LSS).

Unfortunately, it is well-known that it is very difficult to\\nmeasure the magnetic field in the corona, and it can be done only in very special conditions, e.g.,\\nvery strong local field (White et al., 1991). In some cases it is possible to use coronal seismology\\n(first proposed by Uchida, 1970) to determine the average magnetic field strength in an oscillating\\nloop, first used by Nakariakov et al. (1999) and Nakariakov and Ofman (2001), on TRACE loops,\\nand more recently investigated in a number of studies. In some of these studies, for instance,\\nseismological techniques are used in order to measure flare-induced loop oscillations (Ballai et al.,\\n2011) and waves and flows in active region loops (Wang et al., 2013; Uritsky et al., 2013). The\\naccuracy of these methods depends on the correct detection of the temporally and spatially resolved\\nmode of oscillation, and on the details of the loop geometry.\\nSince we cannot determine well the coronal magnetic field, coronal loop geometry deserves\\nspecific analysis. As a good approximation, loops generally have a semicircular shape (Figure 3).\\nThe loop aspect, of course, depends on the loop orientation with respect to the line of sight: loops\\nwith the footpoints on the limb more easily appear as semicircular, as well as loops very inclined\\non the surface near the center of the disk. The assumption of semicircular shape can be useful to\\nmeasure the loop length even in the presence of important deformations due to projection effects:\\nthe de-projected distance of the loop footpoints is the diameter of the arc. However, deviations\\nfrom circularity are rather common and, in general, the detailed analysis of the loop geometry is\\nnot a trivial task. The accurate determination of the loop geometry is rather important for the\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 13\\nFigure 3: Coronal loops have approximately a semicircular shape.

It is less important for the structure\\nand evolution of the confined plasma, which follow the field lines whatever shape they have and\\nchange little also with moderate changes of the gravity component along the field lines. First works\\non the accurate determination of the loop geometry date back to the 1960s (Saito and Billings,\\n1964). More specific ones take advantage of stereoscopic views allowed by huge loops during solar\\nrotation, with the aid of magnetic field reconstruction methods. These studies find deviations\\nfrom ideal circularity and symmetry, not surprising for such large structures (Berton and Sakurai,\\n1985). The geometry of a specific loop observed with TRACE was measured in the framework of a\\ncomplete study including time-dependent hydrodynamic modeling (Reale et al., 2000a,b). In that\\ncase, the discrepancy between the length derived from the distance of the footpoints taken as loop\\ndiameter and the length measured along the loop itself allowed to assess the loop as elongated.\\nLater, a reconstruction of loop geometry was applied to TRACE observation of medium-sized\\noscillating loops, to derive the properties of the oscillations. In this case, a semicircular pattern\\nwas applied (Aschwanden et al., 2002). The importance of the deviations from circularity on\\nconstraining loop oscillations was remarked later (Dymova and Ruderman, 2006).\\nThe STEREO mission is contributing much to the analysis of loop morphology and geometry,\\nthanks to its unique capability to observe the Sun simultaneously from different positions. The\\nthree-dimensional shape of magnetic loops in an active region was first stereoscopically recon-\\nstructed from two different vantage points based on simultaneously recorded STEREO/SECCHI\\nimages (Feng et al., 2007). Five relatively long loops were measured and found to be non-planar\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n14 Fabio Reale\\nand more curved than field lines extrapolated from SoHO/MDI measurements, probably due to the\\ninadequacy of the linear force-free field model used for the extrapolation. A misalignment of 20 –\\n40 deg between theoretical model and observed loops has been quantified from STEREO results\\n(Sandman et al., 2009; DeRosa et al., 2009). Systematic triangulations and 3D reconstructions\\nusing the Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) telescopes on both STEREO spacecrafts were used\\nto derive loop characteristics, such as the loop plane inclination angles (Aschwanden et al., 2008,\\n2009, 2012). Deviations from circularity within 30%, less significant from coplanarity and twisting\\nbelow the threshold for kink instability, were found.\\nAnother interesting issue regarding coronal loop geometry is the analysis of the loop cross-\\nsection, which also provides information about the structure of the coronal magnetic field.\\nYohkoh/ SXT allowed for systematic and quantitative studies of loop morphology and showed\\nthat the cross-section of coronal loops is approximately constant along their length and do not\\nincrease significantly. More in detail, a systematic analysis of a sample of ten loops showed that\\nthe loops tend to be only slightly (∼ 30%) wider at their midpoints than at their footpoints, while\\nfor a bipolar field configuration we would expect expansions by factors. One possible explanation\\nof this effect is the presence of significant twisting of the magnetic field lines and, therefore, the\\ndevelopment of electric currents and strong deviations from a potential field. The effect might be\\nseen either as a twisting of a single loop or as a “braiding” of a bundle of unresolved thin loops (see\\nSection 3.2.2). At the same time it was found that the variation of width along each loop tends to\\nbe modest, implying that the cross section has an approximately circular shape (Klimchuk et al.,\\n1992).\\nFigure 4: Magnetic field lines extrapolated from optical magnetogram superposed on a composite\\nSDO/AIA (211 A˚, 193 A˚, 171 A˚) image, on 7 April 2014.

Important information about the internal structuring of coronal loops comes from the joint\\nanalysis of the photospheric and coronal magnetic field (Figure 4). TRACE loops are quite sym-\\nmetric and their cross-section is constant to a good degree of approximation, at variance from\\nthe prediction by linear force-free extrapolation on SoHO/MDI data (Lo´pez Fuentes et al., 2006).\\nThe magnetic field lines starting from the same footpoint can diverge to different end footpoints,\\nand thus be very complicated with strong tangling of the magnetic flux strands driven by the\\nphotospheric convection. This is not observed at high-resolution in the quiescent corona, possi-\\nbly because of braiding-induced interchange reconnection of the magnetic field (Schrijver, 2007).\\nOther approaches address also the density values and stratification, and explain the evidence with\\na combination of high plasma density within the structures, which greatly increases the emissivity\\nof the structures, and geometric effects that attenuate the apparent brightness of the feature at low\\naltitudes (DeForest, 2007). More recent MHD modeling finds that the temperature distribution\\nacross the loop naturally leads to the appearance of constant cross-section in EUV band (Peter\\nand Bingert, 2012). Another model shows that the apparent constant loop cross section is a result\\nof the non-circular shape of the loops (Malanushenko and Schrijver, 2013).\\nAn alternative analysis of the magnetic field at the footpoints of hot and cool loops showed\\nthat the magnetic filling factor is lower in hot loops (0.05 – 0.3 out of sunspots) than in warm\\nloops (0.2 – 0.6) (Katsukawa and Tsuneta, 2005). The multispectral analysis of solar EUV images\\nhas showed the possibility of separating the different solar structures from a linear combination of\\nimages to emphasise the structures (Dudok de Wit and Auche`re, 2007).\\nThe general impression is that, although moderate deviations from the ideal circular shape with\\nconstant cross-section are often observed, they probably do not affect the description of loops with\\na simplified geometry.\\n3.2.2 Fine structuring\\nIt has been long claimed that coronal loops consist of bundles of thin strands, to scales below the\\ninstrumental resolution (e.g., Go´mez et al., 1993). The issue of fine loop structure is of critical\\nimportance because it constrains the elementary processes that determine the loop ignition. The\\ntask to investigate this substructuring is not easy. Studies based both on models and on analysis\\nof observations independently suggest that elementary loop components should be very fine with\\ntypical cross-sections of the strands on the order of 10 – 100 km (Beveridge et al., 2003; Cargill\\nand Klimchuk, 2004; Vekstein, 2009). First limited evidence of fine structuring was the low filling\\nfactor inferred for loops observed with NIXT (Di Matteo et al., 1999, see Section 3.3.2). The\\nhigh spatial resolution achieved by the TRACE normal-incidence telescope allowed to address the\\ntransverse structure of the imaged coronal loops. EUV images visibly show that coronal loops are\\nsubstructured (Figure 5).\\nThere were some early attempts to study the structure along the single strands in TRACE\\nobservations (Testa et al., 2002). Later, it was shown that in many cases, hot loop structures\\nobserved in active regions with the Yohkoh/SXT (𝑇 > 3 MK) are not exactly co-spatial with\\nwarm structures (𝑇 ∼ 1 – 2 MK) observed in the EUV bands (195 A˚) of the SoHO/EIT, nor they\\ncool down to become visible with EIT (Nagata et al., 2003; Schmieder et al., 2004). In another\\nstudy, hot monolithic loops visible with the Yohkoh/SXT were instead resolved as stranded cooler\\nstructures with TRACE at later times (Winebarger and Warren, 2005), although the large time\\ndelay (1 to 3 hours) is hardly compatible with the cooling time from SXT to TRACE sensitivity.\\nMore systematic studies of TRACE images proposed that about 10% of the positions across loops\\ncan be fitted with an isothermal model, indicating coherent loop components about 2000 km wide\\n(Aschwanden and Nightingale, 2005; Aschwanden et al., 2007).\\nMore recent studies have found other indirect evidence for loop fine structuring. For instance,\\nthe different fuzziness measured in spectral lines forming at different coronal temperatures (Tri-\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n16 Fabio Reale\\nFigure 5: SDO/AIA (193 A˚ channel) image of finely-structured coronal loops (14 October 2011,\\n22:56 UT).

(2012), copyright by AAS.\\npathi et al., 2009) has been modeled with loops made of tens of independently pulse-heated strands\\n(Guarrasi et al., 2010; Reale et al., 2011). Other indirect evidence might come from optical ob-\\nservations of relatively dense and cool (∼ 7000 K) downfalling elongated blobs above the solar\\nlimb, the so-called “coronal rain” (Antolin and Rouppe van der Voort, 2012), with widths of the\\norder of 500 km. Upflows in even narrower channels (∼ 100 km) were resolved in the optical band,\\ncorrelating with brightenings in SDO/AIA observations (Ji et al., 2012).\\nNew direct measurements of the loop fine structure are stimulated by the new observations with\\nnormal-incidence telescopes (SDO/AIA, Hi-C) and by indications that the elementary components\\nof most loops might be small scale and close to be resolved (Brooks et al., 2012). Some quantitative\\nconstraints come from the very high spatial resolution of the Hi-C sounding rocket, with cross-\\nsections that range between about 300 km (Brooks et al., 2013) to over 1000 km (Peter et al.,\\n2013) for long loops, with possibility of further substructuring well below 100 km.\\nEvidence for fine structure can come also from studies of thermal structuring; in general, an\\nemission measure distribution extending over a broad temperature range along the line of sight is\\nretained to be a signature of the presence of multi-stranded structure, because of the coexistence\\nof many thermal components. See Section 3.3 for more details.\\nIn general, there is converging evidence for fine loop structuring to scales on the order of 100 km\\nor below. Ultimate information could be provided by higher resolution future instruments.\\n3.3 Diagnostics and thermal structuring\\nThe investigation of the thermal structure of coronal loops is very important for their exhaustive\\nphysical comprehension and to understand the underlying heating mechanisms. For instance, one\\nof the classifications outlined above is based on the loop thermal regime, and, we remark, it is\\ndebated whether the classification indicates a real physical difference.\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 17\\nDiagnostics of temperature are not trivial in the corona. No direct measurements are available.\\nSince the plasma is optically thin, we receive information integrated on all the plasma column along\\nthe line of sight. The problem is to separate the distinct contributing thermal components and\\nreconstruct the detailed thermal structure along the line of sight. However, even the determination\\nof global and average values deserves great attention. Exploratory measurements have shown that\\nthe ion temperature can be different from the electron temperature in the quiet corona (Landi,\\n2007).\\nModerate diagnostic power is allowed by imaging instruments, by means of multifilter observa-\\ntions. Filter ratio maps (Figure 6) provide information about the spatial distribution of tempera-\\nture and emission measure (e.g., Vaiana et al., 1973). The emission of an optically thin isothermal\\nplasma as measured in a 𝑗-th filter passband is:\\n𝐼𝑗 = 𝐸𝑀 𝐺𝑗(𝑇 ) , (2)\\nwhere 𝑇 is the temperature and 𝐸𝑀 is the emission measure, defined as\\n𝐸𝑀 =\\n∫︁\\n𝑉\\n𝑛2 𝑑𝑉 ,\\nwhere 𝑛 is the particle density, and 𝑉 the plasma volume. The ratio 𝑅𝑖𝑗 of the emission in two\\ndifferent filters 𝑖, 𝑗 is then independent of the density, and only a function of the temperature:\\n𝑅𝑖𝑗 =\\n𝐼𝑖\\n𝐼𝑗\\n=\\n𝐺𝑖(𝑇 )\\n𝐺𝑗(𝑇 )\\n. (3)\\nThe inversion of this relationship provides a value of temperature, based on the isothermal as-\\nsumption.\\nThe limitations of this method are substantial. In particular, one filter ratio value provides one\\ntemperature value for each pixel; this is a reliable measurement, within experimental errors, as long\\nas the assumption of isothermal plasma approximately holds for the plasma column in the pixel\\nalong the line of sight. If the plasma is considerably multithermal, the temperature value is an\\naverage weighted for the instrumental response. Since the response is a highly nonlinear function\\nof the emitting plasma temperature, it is not trivial to interpret the related maps correctly. In\\naddition, it is fundamental to know the instrument response with high precision, in order to avoid\\nsystematic errors, which propagate dangerously when filter ratios are evaluated. In this respect,\\nbroadband filters provide robust thermal diagnostics, because they are weakly dependent on the\\ndetails of the atomic physics models, e.g., on the presence of unknown or not well-known spectral\\nlines, on the choice of element abundances. Narrowband filters can show non-unique dependencies\\nof filter ratio values on temperature (e.g., Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2007), due to the presence\\nof several important spectral lines in the bands, but a more general problem can be the bias to\\ndetect narrow ranges of temperatures forced by the specific instrument characteristics (Weber et al.,\\n2005). This problem can be important especially when the distribution of the emission measure\\nalong the line of sight is not simple and highly nonlinear (e.g., Reale et al., 2009a). New methods\\nfor thermal diagnostics with narrow band instruments have been proposed (Dudok de Wit et al.,\\n2013).\\nThe problem of diagnostics of loop plasma from filter ratios, and, more in general, the whole\\nanalysis of loop observations, are made even more difficult by the invariable presence of other\\nstructures intersecting along the line of sight. A uniform diffuse background emission also affects\\nthe temperature diagnostics, by adding systematic offsets that alter the filter ratio values. The\\ntask of subtracting this “background emission” from the measured emission is non-trivial and can\\nseriously bias the results of the whole analysis. This problem emerged dramatically when the\\nanalysis of the same large loop structure observed with Yohkoh/SXT on the solar limb led to three\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n18 Fabio Reale\\ndifferent results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background (Priest et al., 2000;\\nAschwanden et al., 2001; Reale, 2002a). The amount of background depends on the instrument\\ncharacteristics, such as the passband and the point response function: it is most of the signal\\nin TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g.,\\nDel Zanna and Mason, 2003; Reale and Ciaravella, 2006; Aschwanden et al., 2008; Terzo and Reale,\\n2010). The problem can be mitigated if one analyzes loops as far as possible isolated from other\\nloops, but this is not easy, for instance, in active regions. If this is not the case, broadband filters\\nmay also include contamination from many structures at relatively different temperature and make\\nthe analysis of single loops harder. The problem of background subtraction in loop analysis has\\nbeen addressed by several authors, who apply different subtraction ranging from simple offset, to\\nemission in nearby pixels or subregions, to values interpolated between the loop sides, to whole\\nimages at times when the loop is no longer (or not yet) visible (Testa et al., 2002; Del Zanna and\\nMason, 2003; Schmelz et al., 2003; Aschwanden and Nightingale, 2005; Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;\\nAschwanden et al., 2008; Terzo and Reale, 2010).\\nMore accurate diagnostics, although with less time and space resolution, are in principle pro-\\nvided by spectrometers and observations in temperature-sensitive spectral lines, which are being\\nconstantly improved to provide better and better spatial information. Early results from UV spec-\\ntroscopy already recognized the link between transition region and coronal loops, for instance,\\nfrom Skylab mission (Feldman et al., 1979; Mariska et al., 1980). There is a considerable effort\\nto develop and update continuously the spectral codes and databases, in particular the CHIANTI\\nspectral line database (Dere et al., 1997; Landi et al., 1999; Dere et al., 2001; Landi et al., 2006;\\nDere et al., 2009; Landi et al., 2012a; Del Zanna, 2012; Landi et al., 2013). Together with back-\\nground subtraction, one major difficulty met by spectroscopic analysis is that, in the UV band,\\nthe density of lines is so high that they are often blended and, therefore, it is hard to separate\\nthe contribution of the single lines, especially the weak ones. Fine diagnostics, such as Doppler\\nshifts and line broadening, can become very tricky in these conditions and results are subject to\\ncontinuous revisitation and warnings from the specialized community. The problem of background\\nsubtraction is serious also for spectral data, because their lower spatial and temporal resolution\\ndetermines the presence of more structures and, therefore, more thermal components, along the\\nline of sight in the same spatial element.\\nCare should be paid also when assembling information from many spectral lines into a recon-\\nstruction of the global thermal structure along the line of sight. Methods are well-established\\n(e.g., Gabriel and Jordan, 1975) and several approaches are available. The so-called method of\\nthe emission measure loci (Pottasch, 1963; Jordan et al., 1987; Landi et al., 2002) is able to tell\\nwhether plasma is isothermal of multithermal along the line of sight (Figure 7), but less able to\\nadd details. Detailed emission measure distributions can be obtained from differential emission\\nmeasure (DEM) reconstruction methods (e.g., Brosius et al., 1996; Kashyap and Drake, 1998), but\\nthis is an ill-posed mathematical problem, and, therefore, results are not unique and are subject\\nto systematic and unknown errors.\\nThere is no wide convergence on the reconstruction of the temperature distribution of the\\nemission measure along the line of sight. So several works have been devoted to develop new\\nmethods (e.g., Hannah and Kontar, 2012) and to investigate the limits and capabilities of the\\nmethods themselves. One important question is how far can we push the temperature resolution\\nof the methods. We expect better resolution switching from narrow-band instruments with few\\nchannels (Weber et al., 2005) to spectrometers (Landi and Klimchuk, 2010; Landi et al., 2012b), but\\nit is difficult to achieve a temperature resolution better than Δ log 𝑇 ≈ 0.05 (Landi et al., 2012b).\\nReconstructions from narrow-band data may suffer from biases that affect their reliability (Weber\\net al., 2005) and produce clustering (Guennou et al., 2012a,b). Not only the width and sensitivity\\nof the spectral band is important, but also its position in the temperature range. It has been\\nremarked that, with the available instruments, it is difficult to constrain emission from plasma at\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 19\\n0 100 200 300 400\\nX (arcsec)\\n0\\n100\\n200\\n300\\n400\\nY \\n(ar\\ncs\\nec\\n)\\n \\n \\n 6.600\\n 6.300\\nFigure 6: Temperature map of an active region obtained from the ratio of two images in different\\nbroadband filters with Hinode/XRT (12 November 2006, 12 UT).\\ntemperature above about 6 MK and emission measures less than ∼ 1027 cm−5 (Winebarger et al.,\\n2012). Under some conditions, these limitations might be overcome, as described in Section 3.3.1.\\nIt is also useful to assess unknown uncertainties in the atomic data (Landi et al., 2012b). All-\\nencompassing 3D MHD simulations allow to build a complete cycle from true values to observables\\nback to reconstructed values and comparison with true values (Testa et al., 2012). It is important to\\ntest the combination of all possible uncertainties, the overall capability of the methods, indicating\\nthat a highly non-uniform density distribution along the line of sight can mislead the methods.\\nForward modeling and simulations can be ways to escape from these problems, but they require\\nnon-trivial computational efforts and programming, and it is not always possible to provide accurate\\nconfidence levels. All these approaches are constantly improved and, probably, the best way to\\nproceed is to combine different approaches and multiband observations and to finally obtain a\\nglobal consistency.\\nInteresting issues come from global thermal analysis of the confined solar corona. The analysis\\nof full-disk data from spatially-unresolved SphinX spectral data at the solar minimum of 2009 shows\\ntemperatures of 1.7 – 1.9 MK and emission measures between 4× 1047 cm−3 and 1.1× 1048 cm−3.\\nMost of the emission comes from the large-scale corona rather than localized and bright structures,\\ne.g., bright points (Sylwester et al., 2012).\\nIn addition to the problems intrinsic to diagnostic techniques, we have to consider that loops\\nappear to have different properties in different bands, as mentioned in Section 3.1.1. It is still\\ndebated whether such differences originate from an observational bias due to the instruments or\\nfrom intrinsic physical differences, or both. In view of this uncertainty, in the following we will\\nmake a distinction between hot and warm loops, which will generally correspond to loops observed\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n20 Fabio Reale\\nin the X-ray (and hot UV lines, e.g., Yohkoh/SXT, Hinode/XRT, SoHO/CDS Fexvi line) and in\\nthe UV band (e.g., SoHO/EIT, TRACE), respectively. Cool loops are also observed in the UV\\nband. The boundary between hot and warm loops is, of course, not sharp, and it is not even clear\\nwhether they are aspects of the same basic structure, or they really are physically different and\\nare heated differently (see also Section 3.3.3). We will now devote our attention to the comparison\\nbetween hot and warm loops.\\n3.3.1 Hot loops\\nAfter the pioneering analyses driven by the Skylab X-ray instruments (Section 2), Yohkoh/SXT\\nallowed to conduct large-scale studies on the thermal and structure diagnostics of hot loops, mostly\\nlocated in active region, and the comparison with other instruments, for instance on-board SoHO,\\nallowed to obtain important cross-checks and additional information. Filter ratio maps of flaring\\nloops were shown early after the mission launch (Tsuneta et al., 1992).\\nSystematic measurements of temperature, pressure, and length of tens of both quiescent and\\nactive region coronal loops were conducted on Yohkoh observations in the 1990s (Porter and Klim-\\nchuk, 1995) using the filter ratio method. Steady and isolated loops were selected with a length in\\na decade between 5× 109 < 2𝐿 < 5× 1010 cm. Their average temperature was high, ranging in a\\ndecade (2 < 𝑇 < 30 MK), with a mean of about 6 MK and with large uncertainties in the hot tail\\nof the distribution. Pressure was estimated to span over two decades (0.1 < 𝑝 < 20 dyne cm−2).\\nThe temperature and length were uncorrelated, while the pressure was found overall to vary in-\\nversely with the length (as overall expected for a thermally homogeneous sample from loop scaling\\nlaws, see Section 4.1.1), allowing to constrain the dependence of the magnetic field intensity on\\nthe loop length (Klimchuk and Porter, 1995), and the data uncertainties (Klimchuk and Gary,\\n1995). Another systematic analysis on another sample of Yohkoh loops in active regions (Kano\\nand Tsuneta, 1995) confirmed some of the correlations in Porter and Klimchuk (1995), but also\\nfound a correlation between the loop length and the temperature, and deviations from RTV scaling\\nlaws (Section 4.1.1). The correlations might depend on the loop sample, as a single scaling law\\nlinks three parameters. Very hot Yohkoh/SXT loops were found to have short lifetimes (less than\\nfew hours), and often to exhibit cusps (Yoshida and Tsuneta, 1996).\\nDensity diagnostics through density-sensitive line ratio led to measure directly density values\\nin active regions (e.g., Doschek et al., 2007). The hot core of the active region is densest, with\\nvalues as high as 1010.5 cm−3. Density in active regions has been measured also using Fe lines,\\nwith values in the range 8.5 ≤ log (𝑁e/cm−3) ≤ 11.0 (Young et al., 2009), or in a smaller range\\n(from 108.5 to 109.5 cm−3) (Watanabe et al., 2009). Diagnostics of high density structures are also\\npossible from the analysis of absorbed structures observed with narrow-band imagers (e.g., Landi\\nand Reale, 2013).\\nA big effort has been devoted to the possible detection of hot plasma outside of evident flares.\\nThis would be a conclusive evidence of the presence of impulsive heating mechanisms in coronal\\nloops (e.g., Klimchuk, 2006, see Section 4.4). Hinode instruments appear to be able to provide\\nnew interesting contributions to this topic. The analysis of spectroscopic observations of hot lines\\nin solar active regions from Hinode/EIS allows to construct emission measure distributions in the\\n1 – 5 MK temperature range, and shows that the distributions are flat or slowly increasing up to\\napproximately 3 MK and then fall off rapidly at higher temperatures (Patsourakos and Klimchuk,\\n2009). Emission from very hot lines has been early found in other Hinode/EIS observations, and\\nin particular from the Caxvii at 192.858 A˚, formed near a temperature of 6 × 106 K, in active\\nregions (Ko et al., 2009).\\nThanks to its multifilter observations, also Hinode/XRT is providing useful information about\\nthe thermal structure of the bright X-ray corona. Temperature maps derived with combined filter\\nratios show fine structuring to the limit of the instrument resolution and evidence of multithermal\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 21\\ncomponents (Reale et al., 2007), as complemented by TRACE images. Observations including flare\\nfilters show evidence of a hot component in active regions outside of flares (Schmelz et al., 2009),\\nand data in the medium thickness filters appear to constrain better this component of hot plasma\\nas widespread, although minor, and peaking around log 𝑇 ∼ 6.8 – 6.9, with a tail above 10 MK\\n(Reale et al., 2009b). Further support comes from RHESSI data (Reale et al., 2009a; McTiernan,\\n2009).\\nFurther evidence for minor components of hot plasma in non-flaring active regions have been\\nfound from various other instruments. Analysis in the waveband 3.3 – 6.1 A˚ and 280 – 330 A˚\\nwith the RESIK and SPIRIT instruments, respectively, confirm the presence of a 0.1% ∼ 10 MK\\ncomponent at various activity levels (Sylwester et al., 2010; Shestov et al., 2010). Low-resolution\\nSphinX spectra integrated on 17 days in the 2 – 10 A˚ band still show a small but highly-significant\\ncomponent at about 7 MK from active regions outside of microflares (Miceli et al., 2012). The\\nseparation of the hot from the cool components in the SDO/AIA 94 A˚ channel indicates finely-\\nstructured Fexviii line emission in the core of bright active regions (Reale et al., 2011). This\\nfilamented emission at high temperature has been previously predicted with a model of multi-\\nstranded pulse-heated loops (Guarrasi et al., 2010). The emission from hot emission lines (Caxvii\\nand Fexviii) has been confirmed from simultaneous observations with SDO/AIA and with the\\nHinode/EIS spectrometer (Testa and Reale, 2012; Teriaca et al., 2012). However, while it has\\nbeen proposed that AIA imaging observations of the solar corona can be used to track hot plasma\\n(6 – 8 MK), it has been questioned that such emission is really at the temperature of the line\\nsensitivity peak (Teriaca et al., 2012). Other analysis of a limb active region with EUV spectral\\ndata from Hinode/EIS does not find evidence for plasma at temperature log 𝑇 > 7 (O’Dwyer et al.,\\n2011) and puts an upper limit on the same track as remarked by Winebarger et al. (2012). So a\\nfinal conclusion on this topic is still to be reached. There is some evidence that the amount of\\nhigh-temperature plasma might correlate with the intensity of the active region magnetic fields\\nbecause of increasing frequency of energy release (Warren et al., 2012).\\n3.3.2 Comparison of hot and warm loops\\nBefore the SoHO/EIT and TRACE observations, warm loops had been imaged in a similar spectral\\nband and with similar optics by the rocket NIXT mission (see Section 2). Studies of NIXT loops\\nincluding the comparison with hydrostatic loop models (Section 4.1.1) pointed out that bright\\nspots also visible in H𝛼 band were the footpoints of hot high-pressure loops (Peres et al., 1994).\\nThis result was confirmed by the comparison of the temperature structure obtained from Yohkoh\\nwith NIXT data (Yoshida et al., 1995, see also Section 3.3.3).\\nAnother comparison of loops imaged with NIXT and Yohkoh/SXT showed that the compact\\nloop structures (length ∼ 109 cm) have a good general morphological correspondence, while larger\\nscale NIXT loops (∼ 1010 cm) have no obvious SXT counterpart (Di Matteo et al., 1999). Com-\\nparison with static loop models (see Section 4.1.1) allowed to derive estimates of the loop filling\\nfactors, important for the loop fine structure (Section 3.2.2). In the NIXT band, the filling factor\\nof short loops was found to be very low (10−3 – 10−2), but of the order of unity in the SXT band\\nand for the largest structure. Simultaneous SoHO and Yohkoh observations of a small solar active\\nregion suggested a volume filling factor decreasing with increasing density and possible differences\\nbetween emitting material in active regions and the quiet Sun (Griffiths et al., 2000). Other mea-\\nsurements of the filling factor come from density sensitive lines and images in the EUV band. For\\nbright points the plasma-filling factor has been found to vary from 3× 10−3 to 0.3 with a median\\nvalue of 0.04, which may indicate considerable subresolution structure, or the presence of a single\\ncompletely-filled unresolved loop with subarcsec width (Dere, 2008, 2009).\\nSome similarity between loops observed in the TRACE EUV band and Yohkoh X-ray band\\nwas found in outer active region loops (Nitta, 2000) and interpreted as evidence of loops with a\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n22 Fabio Reale\\nbroad range of temperatures. Core loops were instead observed only in the X-rays and found to\\nbe variable, indicating that probably they are not steady.\\nDensity and temperatures in two active regions were accurately determined from SoHO-CDS\\nobservations (Mason et al., 1999) and it was confirmed quantitatively that the AR cores are hotter\\nthan larger loop structures extending above the limb. The analysis of a single loop observed on the\\nsolar limb with SoHO/CDS showed a bias to obtain flat temperature distributions along the loop\\nfrom ratios of single lines or narrow band filters (TRACE), while a careful DEM reconstruction\\nat selected points along the same loop was inconsistent with isothermal plasma, both across and\\nalong the loop (Schmelz et al., 2001). A whole line of works started from this analysis reconsidering\\nand questioning the basic validity of the temperature diagnostics with TRACE and emphasizing\\nthe importance of the background subtraction, but also the need to obtain accurate spectral data\\n(Schmelz, 2002; Martens et al., 2002; Aschwanden et al., 2002; Schmelz et al., 2003). Similar results\\nbut different conclusions were reached after the analysis of a loop observed with SoHO, invoking\\na non-constant cross-section to explain the evidence of isothermal loop (Landi and Landini, 2004;\\nLandi and Feldman, 2004). On the other hand, evidence of non-uniform temperature along loops\\nobserved with TRACE was also found (Del Zanna and Mason, 2003; Reale and Ciaravella, 2006),\\nemphasizing that the temperature diagnostic with narrow band instruments is a delicate issue.\\nAn interesting debate focussed on the question whether the loops observed with TRACE and\\nCDS have a uniform transverse thermal distribution, i.e., a narrow DEM, or a multi-thermal\\ndistribution, i.e., a wide DEM that may group together warm and hot loops. Although tackled\\nfrom a different perspective, this question also concerns the fine longitudinal structuring of the\\nloops and of their heating and is therefore strictly connected to the subject of Sections 3.2.2 and\\n4.4. A loop imaged by TRACE was found to be isothermal (with temperatures below 1 MK)\\nalong the line of sight from diagnostics of spectral lines obtained with SoHO/CDS (Del Zanna and\\nMason, 2003). The distribution across another loop observed on the limb with SoHO/CDS was\\nfound multi-thermal, with a DEM reconstruction and a careful analysis of background subtraction\\n(Schmelz et al., 2005). From the comparison with the isothermal structure of hot loops derived\\nfrom CDS data (Di Giorgio et al., 2003; Landi and Landini, 2004) and a systematic inspection of\\nthe CDS atlas, the conclusion was that there might be two different classes of loops, multi-thermal\\nand isothermal (Figure 7).\\nComparative studies of active region loops in the transition region and the corona (Ugarte-\\nUrra et al., 2009) observed with Hinode seem to point out the presence of two dominant loop\\npopulations, i.e., core multitemperature loops that undergo a continuous process of heating and\\ncooling in the full observed temperature range 0.4 – 2.5 MK shown by the X-Ray Telescope, and\\nperipheral loops that evolve mostly in the temperature range 0.4 – 1.3 MK.\\nMultiband observations are able to provide more information and constraints. The analysis of\\nan isolated loop in a time-resolved observation in several spectral bands, namely three TRACE\\nUV filters, one Yohkoh/SXT filter, two rasters taken with SoHO/CDS in twelve relevant lines\\n(5.4 ≤ log 𝑇 ≤ 6.4), supported a coherent scenario across the different bands and instruments, i.e.,\\na globally cooling loop and the presence of thermal structuring (Reale and Ciaravella, 2006). The\\nanalysis overall indicated that the loop analysis can be easily affected by a variety of instrumental\\nbiases and uncertainties, for instance due to rough background subtraction. The fact that the loop\\nthat could be well analyzed across several bands and lines is a cooling loop may not be by chance\\n(see end of Section 3.3.3).\\nSoHO spectrometric data have contributed to investigate the loop thermal structure for a\\nlong time. From a differential emission measure (DEM) analysis with a forward-folding technique\\non SoHO/CDS data, some loops were found to be isothermal and others to have a broad DEM\\n(Schmelz et al., 2007, 2008).

This issue is addressed by multi-thread\\nloop modeling (Guarrasi et al., 2010).\\nFigure 8: Loop system observed in several EUV spectral lines with Hinode/EIS (19 May 2007, 11:41 –\\n16:35 UT).

Tripathi.\\nIntensive efforts have been devoted to the analysis of the cool side of the emission measure\\ndistribution of hot loops, using data from EUV spectrometers. There is evidence for dynamic\\nstructure of active regions with frequent condensations inside (Tripathi et al., 2010) and for steep\\ndistributions (Tripathi et al., 2011). Analysis of Hinode and SDO observations were used to\\nreconstruct the emission measure over a broad temperature range (Warren et al., 2011). Although\\naffected by large uncertainties, it was found that at the apex of high-temperature loops the emission\\nmeasure distribution has a relatively sharp peak around 4 MK.\\n3.3.3 Warm loops\\nThe TRACE mission opened new intriguing questions because the data showed new features, e.g.,\\nstranded bright structures mostly localized in active regions, name “the moss”, and because the\\nnarrow band filters offered some limited thermal diagnostics, but not easy to interpret. Reliable\\ntemperatures are in fact found in a very narrow range, and many coronal loops are found to be\\nisothermal in that range.\\nAs mentioned in Section 3.3.2, first loop diagnostics with normal-incidence telescopes were ob-\\ntained from data collected with NIXT (Peres et al., 1994). The bright spots with H𝛼 counterparts\\nwere identified with the footpoints of high pressure loops, invisible with NIXT because not sen-\\nsitive to plasma hotter than 1 MK. They have been later addressed as the moss in the TRACE\\nimages, which undergo the same effect, and their interactions with the underlying chromospheric\\nstructures began to be studied (Berger et al., 1999; Fletcher and De Pontieu, 1999). Comparison\\nof SoHO/CDS and TRACE observations led to establish that the plasma responsible for the moss\\nemission has a temperature range of about 1 MK and is associated with hot loops at 1 – 2 MK,\\nwith a volume filling factor of order 0.1 (Fletcher and De Pontieu, 1999). It was also found that\\nthe path along which the emission originates is of order 1000 km long. According to an analytical\\nloop model, a filling factor of about 0.1 is in agreement with the hypothesis of moss emission from\\nthe legs of 3 MK loops (Martens et al., 2000). The electron density estimated in specific regions in\\nthe active region moss decreases with increasing temperature (Tripathi et al., 2008). The density\\nwithin the moss region was highest at log 𝑇 = 5.8 – 6.1, with a value around 1010 cm−3.\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 25\\nAs for temperature diagnostics with narrow band filters, loops soon appeared to be mostly\\nisothermal with ratios of TRACE filters (Lenz et al., 1999; Aschwanden et al., 2000). Is this a\\nnew class of loops? Equivalent SoHO/EIT filter ratios provided analogous results (Aschwanden\\net al., 1999b). This evidence is intriguing and many investigations have addressed it (see also\\nSection 3.3.2). From the diagnostic perspective, DEM reconstruction along the line of sight from\\nspectral SoHO/CDS data and synthesized EIT count rates led to almost uniform temperatures\\nalong the loop, pointing again to an instrumental bias (Schmelz et al., 2001). Simple modeling\\nconfirmed that, provided they are flat, i.e., top-hat-shaped, even broad DEMs along the line of\\nsight produce constant TRACE filter ratio values (Weber et al., 2005). On the other hand, the\\nDEM obtained from spectrometers and from multi-wideband imagers data is most probably neither\\nisothermal nor broad and flat, instead peaked with components extending both to low and high\\ntemperatures (e.g., Peres et al., 2000; Reale et al., 2009a). The critical point becomes the DEM\\nwidth and its range of variation.\\nUsing combinations of data from three filters, instead of two, does not seem to provide more\\ninformation in the general case for warm loops (Schmelz et al., 2007), but the cross-field thermal\\nstructure of a sample of loops was found to be compatible with multithermal plasma with significant\\nemission measure throughout the range 1 – 3 MK (Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2007). With a\\ncombination of TRACE filter ratios, emission measure loci, and two methods of differential emission\\nmeasure analysis, a few loops were found either isothermal or multithermal (Schmelz et al., 2009).\\nThis might not be a contradiction, in view of the presence of at least three possible conditions of\\nwarm loops, as discussed at the end of this section. Along a coronal loop in an active region on\\nthe solar limb, while TRACE double filter ratios led to temperatures between 1.0 and 1.3 MK,\\nthe emission measure loci from CDS data were consistent with a line-of-sight isothermal structure\\nwhich increases in temperature from ∼ 1.20 to 1.75 MK along the loop, in contrast with the nearby\\nmultithermal background (Noglik et al., 2008).\\nAnother puzzling issue, certainly linked to the loop isothermal appearance, is that warm loops\\nare often diagnosed to be overdense with respect to the equilibrium values predicted by loop scaling\\nlaws (Lenz et al., 1999; Winebarger et al., 2003a, Section 4.1.1). To explain both these pieces of\\nevidence, several authors claimed that the loops cannot be at equilibrium and that they must\\nbe filamented and cooling from a hotter state, probably continuously subject to heating episodes\\n(nanoflares, Warren et al., 2002, 2003, Sections 4.2 and 4.4). Other authors proposed that part of\\nthe effect might be due to inaccurate background subtraction (Del Zanna and Mason, 2003).\\nThe Hinode mission has stimulated extensive analyses of warm coronal structures, mostly based\\non its high quality EIS spectral data. Modeling observations of coronal moss with Hinode/EIS\\nconfirmed that the moss intensities predicted by steady, uniformly heated loop models are too\\nintense relative to the observations (Warren et al., 2008b). A nonuniform filling factor is required\\nand must vary inversely with the loop pressure. Observations of active region loops with EIS\\nindicate that isolated coronal loops that are bright in Fexii generally have very narrow temperature\\ndistributions (3× 105 K), but are not properly isothermal and have a volumetric filling factors of\\napproximately 10% (Warren et al., 2008a).\\nIn a cooler regime (4.15 < log 𝑇 < 5.45) observed in coordination by SoHO spectrometers and\\nimagers, STEREO/EUVI, and Hinode/EIS, active region plasma at the limb has been found to\\ncool down from a coronal hole status with temperatures in the 5.6 < log 𝑇 < 5.9 range (Landi\\net al., 2009).\\nA loop reconstruction from STEREO data improves the background subtraction and recov-\\ners density and temperature distributions that are able to reproduce the total observed fluxes\\nwithin 20% (Aschwanden et al., 2009), emission measure distributions not very different from\\nthose obtained from spectroscopic observations (Brosius et al., 1996), and is in agreement with\\nother previous studies (Lenz et al., 1999; Winebarger et al., 2003a).\\nSome studies have been devoted specifically to fan loops departing from active regions and\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n26 Fabio Reale\\nobserved with Hinode and SDO. It was found that these loops are warm and their temperature\\ndistribution is generally narrow (Brooks et al., 2011).\\nMore recently, accurate analysis of warm loops with comparison between EUV spectroscopy\\nand multi-channel imaging with Hinode/EIS and SDO/AIA have put severe warnings on using the\\nlatter for DEM reconstruction (Del Zanna et al., 2011). Cool plasma at temperature 𝑇 < 0.5 MK\\nmight contribute considerably to the emission, especially at the loop footpoints, and question, for\\ninstance, the interpretation of upflows observed in the 171 A˚ band as made of million degrees\\nplasma (De Pontieu et al., 2011). Important results come from observations at very high spatial\\nresolution (0.2 arcsec) with the Hi-C sounding rocket in the EUV 193 A˚ band. There is evidence\\nof magnetic braiding that indicates the occurrence of magnetic reconnection (Cirtain et al., 2013).\\nIn summary, the current observational framework and loop analysis seems to indicate that for\\na coherent scenario warm loops are manifestations of at least three different loop conditions: i) in\\nloops consisting of bundles of thin independently-heated strands, few cooling strands of steady hot\\nX-ray loops might be detected as warm overdense loops in the UV band. These warm loops would\\ncoexist with hot loops and would show a multithermal emission measure distribution (Patsourakos\\nand Klimchuk, 2007; Warren et al., 2008a; Tripathi et al., 2009); ii) we might have warm loops as\\nan obvious result of a relatively low average heating input in the loop. These loops would be much\\nless visible in the X-rays and, thus, would not be co-spatial with hot loops, and would also be much\\nless multithermal (Di Giorgio et al., 2003; Landi and Feldman, 2004; Aschwanden and Nightingale,\\n2005; Noglik et al., 2008); iii) warm loops might be globally cooling from a status of hot X-ray\\nloop (Reale and Ciaravella, 2006). These loops would also be overdense and co-spatial with hot\\nloops but with a time shift of the X-ray and UV light curves, i.e., they would be bright in the\\nX-rays before they are in the UV band. Also these loops would have a relatively narrow thermal\\ndistribution along the line of sight. There is some indication that there might be fundamental\\ndifferences in the heating regime and cadence between hot and warm loops (Warren et al., 2010a).\\n3.4 Temporal analysis\\nThe solar corona is the site of a variety of transient phenomena. Coronal loops sometimes flare\\nin active regions (see the review by Benz, 2008). However, most coronal loops are well-known\\nto remain in a steady state for most of their life, much longer than the plasma characteristic\\ncooling times (Rosner et al., 1978, see Section 4.1.1). This is taken as an indication that a heating\\nmechanism must be on and steady long enough to bring the loop to an equilibrium condition,\\nand keep it there for a long time. Nevertheless, the emission of coronal loops is found to vary\\nsignificantly on various timescales, and the temporal analyses of coronal loop data have been used\\nto obtain different kinds of information, and as a help to characterize the dynamics and heating\\nmechanisms. The time variability of loop emission is generally not trivial to interpret. The problem\\nis that the emission is very sensitive to density and less to temperature. Therefore, variations are\\nnot direct signatures of heating episodes, not even of local compressions, because the plasma is\\nfree to flow along the magnetic field lines. Variations must therefore be explained in the light of\\nthe evolution of the whole loop. This typically needs accurate modeling, or, at least, care must be\\npaid to many relevant and concurrent effects.\\nAnother important issue is the band in which we observe. The EUV bands of the normal-\\nincidence telescopes are quite narrow. Observations are then more sensitive to variations because\\ncooling or heating plasma is seen to turn on and off rapidly as it crosses the band sensitivity.\\nOn the other hand, telescopes in the X-ray band detect hotter plasma which is expected to be\\nmore sensitive to heating and therefore to vary more promptly, but the bandwidths are large\\nand do not take as much advantage of the temperature sensitivity as the narrow bands. Finally,\\nspectroscopic observations are, in principle, very sensitive to temperature variations, because they\\nobserve single lines, but their time cadence is typically low and able to follow variations only on\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 27\\nlarge timescales. Time analysis studies can be classified to address two main classes of phenomena:\\ntemporal variability of steady structures and single transient events, such as flare-like brightenings.\\nIn spite of limited time coverage, the instrument S-054 on-board Skylab already allowed for\\nearly studies of variability of hot X-ray loops. Measured decay times showed evidence of continued\\nevaporation of coronal plasma in slowly-decaying structures (Krieger, 1978). found timescales of\\nmoderate variability was found on the timescale of a few hours over a substantial steadiness for\\nobservations of active region loops in 2 MK lines such as Fexv and Sixii (Sheeley Jr, 1980; Habbal\\net al., 1985). Continuous microflare activity (1026 – 1028 erg) has been extensively detected in hard\\nX-ray band (20 keV) with non-thermal power-law spectra (Lin et al., 1984). Substantial (but\\nnon-flaring) temporal variability was found in active region loops observed with SMM in a few\\nrelatively hot X-ray lines (∼ 5 MK) on timescales of some minutes (Haisch et al., 1988). Cooler\\nloops (< 1 MK Foukal, 1976, see Section 3.5) were found to be more variable and dynamic (e.g.,\\nKopp et al., 1985).\\nThe high time coverage and resolution of Yohkoh triggered studies of brightenings on short\\ntimescales. The study of the interaction of differently bright hot loops showed, for instance, that\\nX-ray bright points often involve loops considerably larger than the bright points themselves, and\\nthat they vary on timescales from minutes to hours (Strong et al., 1992). The analysis of a large set\\n(142) of macroscopic transient X-ray brightenings indicated that they derive from the interaction of\\nmultiple loops at their footpoints (Shimizu et al., 1994). Some other more specific loop variations,\\ne.g., the shrinkage of large-scale non-flare loops were also observed, and interpreted not as an\\napparent motion, but as a real contraction of coronal loops that brighten and then gradually cool\\ndown (Wang et al., 1997). Fine-scale motions and brightness variations of the emission were found\\non timescales of 1 minute or less, often with dark jets of chromospheric plasma seen in the wings of\\nH𝛼, and probably associated with the fine structure and dynamics of the upper transition region\\n(Berger et al., 1999).\\nLoop variability was specifically studied in several UV spectral lines observed with SoHO/CDS\\nfor about 3 hours by Di Giorgio et al. (2003). In the hottest lines, within the limited time resolution\\nof about 10 min, a few brightenings of a hot loop (∼ 2 MK) were detected but they are minor\\nperturbations over a steadily high emission level. A cool loop (log 𝑇 ∼ 5.3) was confirmed to be a\\ntransient structure living a few hours, and confining substantial flows (Section 3.5).\\nVariability analyses were conducted also on warm loops present in TRACE data. The bright-\\nening of a single coronal loop was analyzed in detail in an observation of more than 2 hours with\\na cadence of about 30 s (Reale et al., 2000a). The loop brightens from the footpoints to the top,\\nallowing for detailed hydrodynamic modeling (Reale et al., 2000b, see also Section 4.4). Active re-\\ngion transient events, i.e., short-lived brightenings in small-scale loops, detected over a neutral line\\nin a region of emerging flux were interpreted as reconnection events associated with flux emergence\\n(Seaton et al., 2001). Apparent shrinking and expansion of brightening warm loops suggested\\nheating and cooling of different concentric strands, leading to coronal rain visible in the H𝛼 line\\n(Shimojo et al., 2002, see also Section 3.2.2). Plasma condensations in hot and warm loops were\\ndetected also in the analysis of line intensity and velocity in temporal series data from SoHO/CDS\\n(O’Shea et al., 2007). Antiochos et al. (2003) found no significant variability of the moss regions\\nobserved with TRACE. This has been taken as part of the evidence toward steady coronal heating\\nin active region cores (Warren et al., 2010b, see Section 4.4).\\nThe analysis of temporal series from various missions has been used to investigate the possible\\npresence of continuous impulsive heating by nanoflares. The temporal evolution of hot coronal loops\\nwas studied in data taken with GOES Solar X-ray Imager (SXI), an instrument with moderate\\nspatial resolution and spectral band similar to Yohkoh/SXT (Lo´pez Fuentes et al., 2007). The\\ndurations and characteristic timescales of the emission rise, steady and decay phases were found to\\nbe much longer than the cooling time and indicate that the loop-averaged heating rate increases\\nslowly, reaches a maintenance level, and then decreases slowly (Figure 9), not in contradiction\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n28 Fabio Reale\\nwith the early results of Skylab (Section 2). This slow evolution is taken as an indication of a\\nsingle heating mechanism operating for the entire lifetime of the loop. If so, the timescale of the\\nloop-averaged heating rate might be roughly proportional to the timescale of the observed intensity\\nvariations.\\nFigure 9: X-ray light curve observed with the SXI telescope on board GOES. The loop lifetime is much\\nlonger than the characteristic cooling times. Courtesy of J. A. Klimchuk and M. C. Lo´pez Fuentes).\\nJoint TRACE and SoHO/CDS observations allowed to study temperature as a function of time\\nin active region loops (Cirtain et al., 2007). In many locations along the loops, the emission measure\\nloci were found consistent with an isothermal structure, but the results also indicated significant\\nchanges in the loop temperature (between 1 and 2 MK) over the 6 hr observing period. This was\\ninterpreted as one more indication of multistranded loops, substructured below the resolution of\\nthe imager and of the spectrometer. Further support to fine structuring comes from the analysis\\nof the auto-correlation functions in SXT and TRACE loop observations (Sakamoto et al., 2008).\\nThe duration of the intensity fluctuations for the hot SXT loops was found to be relatively short\\nbecause of the significant photon noise, but that for the warm TRACE loops agrees well with\\nthe characteristic cooling timescale, thus supporting a continuous heating by impulsive nanoflares.\\nThe energy of nanoflares is estimated to be 1025 erg for SXT loops and 1023 erg for TRACE loops,\\nand their occurrence rate about 0.4 and 30 nanoflares s–1, respectively.\\nTime series have been studied also on data taken with the Hinode mission. Hinode’s Solar Op-\\ntical Telescope (SOT) magnetograms and high-cadence EIS spectral data were used to distinguish\\nhot, relatively steadily emitting warm coronal loops from isolated transient brightenings and to\\nfind that they are both associated with highly dynamic magnetic flux regions. Brightenings were\\nconfirmed in regions of flux collision and cancellation, while warm loops are generally rooted in\\nmagnetic field regions that are locally unipolar with unmixed flux (Brooks et al., 2008). It was\\nsuggested that the type of heating (transient vs. steady) is related to the structure of the magnetic\\nfield, and that the heating in transient events may be fundamentally different from that in warm\\ncoronal loops.\\nMore recently, light curves in individual pixels have been investigated in the X-ray band to\\nsearch for significant variability connected to variable heating. Although some pulses are detected,\\nmost of the emission in active region cores and loops has been found to be steady on the timescale\\nof hours with fluctuations on the order of 15% and with no correlation between warm and hot\\nemission (Warren et al., 2010b, 2011). Improving on previous studies (Sakamoto et al., 2008),\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 29\\nhigh cadence observations with the Hinode/XRT have revealed that the distributions of intensity\\nfluctuations have small but significant and systematic asymmetries. Part of this asymmetry has\\nbeen explained through a tendency for exponentially decreasing intensity, i.e., the plasma has been\\ncooling for most of the time (Terzo et al., 2011).\\nLoop light curves have been systematically analysed also in the EUV band. A systematic\\ntendency has been found to have ordered time lags from channels sensitive to emission from hotter\\nplasma to cooler plasma, that is also evidence for dominant cooling (Viall and Klimchuk, 2011,\\n2012). Light curves in the EUV band have been analysed also with a different approach: they\\nhave been compared to simulated ones obtained from sequences of random pulses with power-\\nlaw distribution (Tajfirouze and Safari, 2012). Artificial neural network (ANN) was used for the\\ncomparison and it was found many that light curves are matched by those generated from events\\npower-laws with a steep index (≥ 2). While studying the long-term evolution of active regions on\\nthe large scale, it was found that active regions show less and less variability as they age (Ugarte-\\nUrra and Warren, 2012), thus suggesting a qualitative change of heating frequency with time.\\nAt the other extreme of the smallest scales, the Hi-C observations show in some moss regions\\nvariability on timescales down to ∼ 15 s, that may indicate the presence of heating pulses of\\ncomparable duration.\\n3.5 Flows and waves\\nDiagnosing the presence of significant flows in coronal loops is not an easy task. Apparently moving\\nbrightness variations may not be a conclusive evidence of plasma motion, since the same effect may\\nbe produced by the propagation of thermal fronts or waves. Conclusive evidence of plasma motion\\ncomes from measurements of Doppler shifts in relevant spectral lines. However, the detection of\\nsignificant Doppler shifts requires several conditions to be fulfilled at the same time, e.g., significant\\ncomponent along the line of sight, amount of moving plasma larger than amount of static plasma,\\nplasma motion comparable to typical line broadening effects.\\nIn general, we can distinguish two main classes of mass bulk motions inside coronal loops:\\nsiphon flows, due to a pressure difference between the footpoints, and loop filling or draining, due\\nto transient heating and subsequent cooling, respectively. Some other evidence of bulk motions,\\nsuch as systematic redshifts in UV lines, has been difficult to interpret.\\nSiphon flows have been mainly invoked to explain motions in cool loops. The existence of cold\\nloops has been known for a long time (Foukal, 1976, see Section 2) and SoHO has collected high-\\nquality data showing the presence of dynamic cool loops (Brekke et al., 1997). A well-identified\\ndetection was found in SoHO/SUMER data, i.e., a small loop showing a supersonic siphon-like\\nflow (Teriaca et al., 2004) and in SoHO/CDS data (Di Giorgio et al., 2003).\\nRedshifts in transition region UV lines have been extensively observed on the solar disk (e.g.,\\nDoschek et al., 1976; Gebbie et al., 1981; Dere, 1982; Feldman et al., 1982; Klimchuk, 1987; Rottman\\net al., 1990; Brekke, 1993; Peter, 1999). Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain these red-\\nshifts: downward propagating acoustic waves (Hansteen, 1993), downdrafts driven by radiatively-\\ncooling condensations in the solar transition region (Reale et al., 1996, 1997b), nanoflares (Teriaca\\net al., 1999); the scenario is improving with the better and better definition of the observational\\nframework. Downflows are systematically confirmed in lines at transition region temperatures\\n(≤ 0.5 MK) from a few km s–1 (Feldman et al., 2011) to a few tens km s–1 (Chen and Ding, 2010;\\nUgarte-Urra and Warren, 2011). Moderate downflows have been detected at the boundary of\\nactive regions (Boutry et al., 2012). Redshifts between 5 and 15 km s–1 have been measured accu-\\nrately from SoHO/SUMER data in three active regions with little spatial and temporal correlation\\n(Winebarger et al., 2013).\\nBlueshifts in the transition region are also studied but not necessarily associated with coro-\\nnal loops (e.g., Dere et al., 1986). More localized and transient episodes of high velocity outflows,\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n30 Fabio Reale\\nnamed explosive events, have been observed in the transition lines such as C iv, formed at 100 000 K\\n(e.g., Dere et al., 1989; Chae et al., 1998b; Winebarger et al., 1999, 2002b,a). However, there are\\nindications that such EUV explosive events are not directly relevant in heating the corona, are\\ncharacteristic of structures not obviously connected with the upper corona, and have a chromo-\\nspheric origin (Teriaca et al., 2002). Moderate outflows at about 1 MK or more have been found\\nfrom combined SoHO/SUMER and Hinode/EIS observations of the quiet Sun around disk center\\n(Dadashi et al., 2011).\\nDoppler shifts have been extensively studied as a function of temperature across the transition\\nregion. Figure 10 shows a summary of the results updated to 2011.\\nFigure 10: Average Doppler shift in the quiet Sun at disk center of various TR and coronal ions measured\\nfrom SUMER and EIS spectra.

(2011), copyright by ESO.\\nRedshifts increasing up to ∼ 10 km s–1 at ∼ 2 × 105 K and then decreasing with increasing\\ntemperature have been found from SUMER and EIS spectra in the quiet Sun and explained by\\nthe dominance of emission from plasma flowing downward from the upper hot region to the lower\\ncool region along flux tubes with varying cross section (a factor about 30, Chae et al., 1998c, see\\nalso Section 3.1). The redshift peak increases to 15 km s–1 in an active region at temperature\\nof 105 K, while the redshifts were found to turn into blueshifts at temperatures above 5 × 105 K\\n(Teriaca et al., 1999). The trend from redshift to blueshift also applies to active region moss, but\\nthe transition from red to blue appears to occur at a higher temperature in the moss (∼ 1 MK\\nversus 0.5 MK in the quiet Sun) (Dadashi et al., 2012; Tripathi et al., 2012b).\\nRegarding the spatial localization of the flows, a complex scenario of Doppler flows was found\\nin active region loops observed by Hinode EIS (Del Zanna, 2008, Figure 11). Persistent redshifts,\\nstronger in cooler lines (about 5 – 10 km s–1 in Fexii and 20 – 30 km s–1 in Feviii), were confirmed\\nin most loop structures. Persistent blueshifts, stronger in the hotter lines (typically 5 – 20 km s–1\\nin Fexii and 10 – 30 km s–1 in Fexv), were present in areas of weak emission, in a sharp boundary\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 31\\nbetween the low-lying “hot” 3 MK loops and the higher “warm” 1 MK loops.\\nAn active region was comprised of red-shifted emissions (downflows) in the core and blue-\\nshifted emissions (upflows) at the boundary (Tripathi et al., 2009). No strong flows were found\\nin an active region core in the Hinode/EIS Fexii 195 A˚ line (Brooks and Warren, 2009). In the\\ncore of moss regions SUMER and EIS data show some blueshifts of a few km s–1 at low coronal\\ntemperatures, decreasing at higher temperatures (Dadashi et al., 2012). Specific studies of coronal\\nloops in an active region show mostly blue-shifted emission at coronal temperatures, with speed of\\nabout 20 km s–1 at the footpoints (Tripathi et al., 2012a).\\nFigure 11: Monochromatic (negative) images and dopplergrams km s–1) of an active region (NOAA\\n10926) observed with Hinode/EIS in Feviii, Fexii, Fexv lines. Courtesy of G. Del Zanna.\\nNon-thermal velocities in the transition region and corona of the quiet Sun were measured from\\nthe widths of SoHO/SUMER UV lines (Chae et al., 1998a). They were found to increase with\\ntemperature from values smaller than 10 km s–1 at temperatures < 2× 104 K, to a peak value of\\n30 km s–1 around 3 × 105, and then to increase with temperature, to about 20 km s–1 at coronal\\ntemperatures. Since the motions are small-scale and isotropic they were interpreted in terms of\\nMHD turbulence. Non-thermal velocities were studied also in solar active regions on Hinode/EIS\\nspectra (Doschek et al., 2007). The largest widths seem to be located more in relatively faint zones,\\nsome of which also show Doppler outflows.\\nCoronal plasma motions near footpoints of active region loops showed a strong correlation\\nbetween Doppler velocity and non-thermal velocity (Hara et al., 2008). Significant deviations from\\na single Gaussian profile were found in the blue wing of the line profiles for the upflows. These\\nmay suggest that there are unresolved high-speed upflows.\\nEUV spectra of coronal loops above active regions show also clear evidence of stronger dy-\\nnamical activity. In the Ov 629 A˚ line, formed at 240 000 K, line-of-sight velocities greater than\\n50 km s–1 have been measured with the shift extending over a large fraction of a loop (Brekke et al.,\\n1997). Active region loops appear to be extremely time variable and dynamic at transition region\\ntemperatures, with large Doppler shifts (Brekke, 1999). The birth, evolution and cooling of one\\nof such transient cool loops was directly observed with the SoHO/CDS, and a blue-shifted upflow\\nwas measured all along the loop, probably a one-direction siphon flow (Di Giorgio et al., 2003, see\\nalso Section 3.5). Line-of-sight flows of up to 40 km s–1 were measured along warm and apparently\\nstatic active region loops in co-aligned TRACE and the SoHO/SUMER observations (Winebarger\\net al., 2002c). Apparent motions were also detected in other TRACE images (Winebarger et al.,\\n2001). Strong localized outflows (∼ 50 km s–1) in a widespread downflow region were clearly visible\\nin Doppler-shifts maps obtained with EIS (Doschek et al., 2008). The outflows might be tracers\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n32 Fabio Reale\\nof long loops and/or open magnetic fields. High-speed outflows at about 1 MK or more have been\\nfound in microflares (Chen and Ding, 2010), and transient ones at the boundary of active region\\ncores on the timescale of minutes in time sequences of EIS spectra (Ugarte-Urra and Warren,\\n2011). Studies on the temperature structure and chemical composition of the plasma producing\\nthe faint blue wings at about 100 km s–1 have shown a peaks at coronal temperatures above 1 MK\\nand coronal FIP bias values (Brooks and Warren, 2012). Cool plasma flowing in multi-threaded\\ncoronal loops were detected in high resolution Hinode SOT observations with speeds in the range\\n74 – 123 km s–1 (Ofman and Wang, 2008). In addition to flows, the loops exhibited transverse os-\\ncillations. Even stronger upflows, more typical of flare chromospheric evaporation (e.g., Antonucci\\net al., 1982), have also been detected during some small transient brightenings in the X-ray band\\n(Hinode/XRT), with speeds up to 500 km s–1 (Nitta et al., 2012).\\n3.5.1 Chromospheric flows\\nIt has been proposed that an important role in the dynamics and heating of plasma inside coronal\\nloops might be played by upcoming chromospheric flows. Although the discovery is not new (Athay\\nand Holzer, 1982), recently much attention has been devoted to these flows, and in particular to a\\nspecific class of finger-like ejections with speeds between 50 and 150 km s–1 and lasting a couple\\nof minutes or less, the so-called type II spicules (De Pontieu et al., 2007a). There is evidence for\\na spatial and temporal correlation between spicules and faint upflows detected in the EUV band\\nsuggesting the possibility that the flows are heated to coronal temperatures when they are injected\\nin coronal loops. The upflows were detected as a blue-shifted excess (wing asymmetry) in an EUV\\nline (Fexiv). The implication is that spicules may provide a substantial contribution to coronal\\nheating, thus shifting the source of coronal heating down in the chromosphere (De Pontieu et al.,\\n2009) and proposing a new challenge for coronal heating theory. The evidence is debated. Wave-\\nlike propagations in coronal EUV images have been also re-interpreted as evidence for repetitive\\nupflows (Tian et al., 2011; Kamio et al., 2011). However, 3D MHD modeling shows that waves\\nand flows may results from the same impulsive events (Ofman et al., 2012), while flows may\\nbe important very low in the corona, the propagating disturbances are dominated by waves at\\nhigher altitudes in active region loop (Wang et al., 2013). Coronal counterparts have been directly\\nidentified in EUV images (De Pontieu et al., 2011) and also a correspondence between upflows and\\ndownflows, the latter at moderate speed (∼ 10 km s–1) and in the cool passbands (McIntosh et al.,\\n2012). These are to be compared with the usual evidence of redshifts in the transition region. In\\nother analyses high speed spicules were not found to have coronal counterparts (Madjarska et al.,\\n2011) and to be a separate population from lower speed spicules (Zhang et al., 2012). It has been\\nestimated that only a small fraction of coronal plasma can be supplied by chromospheric upflows\\n(Klimchuk, 2012).\\n3.5.2 Waves observations\\nAlthough this review focusses more on the plasma confined in loops, recently considerable efforts\\nhave been devoted to models that point to the importance of magnetohydrodynamic waves. The\\nquestion is again the contribution of the dissipation of wave energy to the heating of the corona,\\nthat is not easy to evaluate (Klimchuk, 2006). The wave propagation is often connected to and\\nneeds to be distinguished from the presence of flows. Therefore, we dedicate attention to recent\\nevidences regarding coronal waves and oscillations that involve loops.\\nEvidence for photospheric Alfve´n waves was obtained from magnetic and velocity fluctuations in\\nregions of strong magnetic field (Ulrich, 1996) and from granular motions in the quiet Sun (Muller\\net al., 1994) with fluxes of the order of 107 erg cm−2 s−1, which might contribute to heating if\\ntransmitted efficiently to the corona.\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 33\\nIn SoHO/EIT high-cadence 304 A˚ images, analyzed systematic intensity variations along an off-\\nlimb half loop structure were observed to propagate from the top toward the footpoints (De Groof\\net al., 2004). These intensity variations are more probably be due to flowing/falling plasma blobs\\nthan to slow magneto-acoustic waves (Section 4.4). This evidence has been addressed also by\\nmodeling studies (see Section 4.3).\\nWidespread evidence for outward propagation of Alfve´n waves is reported from ground optical\\npolarimetric observations (Tomczyk et al., 2007), and non-thermal broadening has been shown\\nto correlate (McIntosh and De Pontieu, 2012) with swaying motions detected in the corona from\\nSDO/AIA data (speed of ∼ 20 km s–1 and periods of few minutes) (McIntosh et al., 2011). TRACE\\nEUV observations provided the first evidence of resolved transverse waves in coronal loops (As-\\nchwanden et al., 1999a; Nakariakov et al., 1999; Nakariakov and Ofman, 2001). Undamped, or even\\ngrowing waves were observed by SDO/AIA (Wang et al., 2012; Nistico` et al., 2013). Transverse\\nwaves were detected also in high resolution observations with the HiC in thin loops (≥ 100 km)\\nat low speed amplitude (Morton and McLaughlin, 2013). The contribution of this class of waves\\nis estimated, discussed, and debated although there is still no clear convergence. Other oscilla-\\ntions were observed to propagate along coronal loops at more than 100 km s–1 with periods of\\na few minutes and interpreted as slow magnetosonic waves (De Moortel et al., 2000), but also\\nas due to faint upflows (De Pontieu and McIntosh, 2010). We mention that also much faster\\n(> 1000 km s–1) propagating oscillations were detected in SDO/AIA observations during eruptive\\nevents and interpreted as fast magnetosonic waves (e.g., Liu et al., 2011; Ofman et al., 2011).\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n34 Fabio Reale\\n4 Loop Physics and Modeling\\n4.1 Basics\\nThe basics of loop plasma physics are well established since the 1970s (e.g., Priest, 1978). In typical\\ncoronal conditions, i.e., ratio of thermal and magnetic pressure 𝛽 ≪ 1, temperature of a few MK,\\ndensity of 108 – 1010 cm−3, the plasma confined in coronal loops can be assumed as a compressible\\nfluid moving and transporting energy only along the magnetic field lines, i.e., along the loop itself\\n(e.g., Rosner et al., 1978; Vesecky et al., 1979). In this configuration, the magnetic field has\\nonly the role of confining the plasma. It is also customary to assume constant loop cross-section\\n(see Section 3.2.1). In these conditions, and neglecting gradients across the direction of the field,\\neffects of curvature, non uniform loop shape, magnetic twisting, currents and transverse waves, the\\nplasma evolution can be described by means of the one-dimensional hydrodynamic equations for\\na compressible fluid, using only the coordinate along the loop (Figure 12).\\n\\x02\\x01\\nFigure 12: The plasma confined in a loop can be described with one-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling,\\nwith a single coordinate (𝑠) along the loop. Image: TRACE, 6 November 1999, 2 UT.\\nThe time-dependent equations of mass, momentum, and energy conservation typically include\\nthe effects of the gravity component along the loop, the radiative losses from an optically thin\\nplasma, the plasma thermal conduction, an external heating input, the plasma compressional\\nviscosity:\\n𝑑𝑛\\n𝑑𝑡\\n= −𝑛𝜕𝑣\\n𝜕𝑠\\n, (4)\\n𝑛𝑚H\\n𝑑𝑣\\n𝑑𝑡\\n= −𝜕𝑝\\n𝜕𝑠\\n+ 𝑛𝑚H𝑔 +\\n𝜕\\n𝜕𝑠\\n(𝜇\\n𝜕𝑣\\n𝜕𝑠\\n) , (5)\\n𝑑𝜖\\n𝑑𝑡\\n+ (𝑝+ 𝜖)\\n𝜕𝑣\\n𝜕𝑠\\n= 𝐻 − 𝑛2𝛽𝑖𝑃 (𝑇 ) + 𝜇\\n(︂\\n𝜕𝑣\\n𝜕𝑠\\n)︂2\\n+ 𝐹𝑐 , (6)\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 35\\nwith 𝑝 and 𝜖 defined by:\\n𝑝 = (1 + 𝛽𝑖)𝑛𝑘B𝑇 , 𝜖 =\\n3\\n2\\n𝑝+ 𝑛𝛽𝑖𝜒 , (7)\\nand the conductive flux:\\n𝐹𝑐 =\\n𝜕\\n𝜕𝑠\\n(︂\\n𝜅𝑇 5/2\\n𝜕𝑇\\n𝜕𝑠\\n)︂\\n, (8)\\nwhere 𝑛 is the hydrogen number density, 𝑠 the spatial coordinate along the loop, 𝑣 the plasma\\nvelocity, 𝑚H the mass of hydrogen atom, 𝜇 the effective plasma viscosity, 𝑃 (𝑇 ) the radiative losses\\nfunction per unit emission measure (e.g., Raymond et al., 1976), 𝛽𝑖 the fractional ionization, i.e.,\\n𝑛e/𝑛H, 𝐹𝑐 the conductive flux, 𝜅 the thermal conductivity (Spitzer, 1962), 𝑘B the Boltzmann\\nconstant, and 𝜒 the hydrogen ionization potential. 𝐻(𝑠, 𝑡) is a function of both space and time\\nthat describes the heat input in the loop.\\nThese equations can be solved numerically and several specific codes have been used extensively\\nto investigate the physics of coronal loops and of X-ray flares (e.g., Nagai, 1980; Peres et al., 1982;\\nDoschek et al., 1982; Nagai and Emslie, 1984; Fisher et al., 1985a,a,a; MacNeice, 1986; Gan et al.,\\n1991; Hansteen, 1993; Betta et al., 1997; Antiochos et al., 1999; Ofman and Wang, 2002; Mu¨ller\\net al., 2003; Bradshaw and Mason, 2003; Sigalotti and Mendoza-Bricen˜o, 2003; Bradshaw and\\nCargill, 2006).\\nThe concept of numerical loop modeling is to use simulations, first of all, to get insight into\\nthe physics of coronal loops, i.e., the reaction of confined plasma to external drivers, to describe\\nplasma evolution, and to derive predictions to compare with observations. One major target of\\nmodeling is of course to discriminate between concurrent hypotheses, for instance, regarding the\\nheating mechanisms, and to constrain the related parameters.\\nThe models require to be provided with initial loop conditions and boundary conditions. It\\nhas been shown that time-dependent loop models must include a relatively thick, cool, and dense\\nchromosphere and the transition region for a correct description of the mass transfer driven by\\ntransient heating (e.g., Bradshaw and Cargill, 2013) and to maintain the necessary numerical\\nstability (Antiochos, 1979; Hood and Priest, 1980; Peres et al., 1982). The main role of the\\nchromosphere is only that of a mass reservoir and, therefore, in several codes, it is treated as\\nsimply as possible, e.g., an isothermal inactive layer that neither emits, nor conducts heat. In\\nother cases, a more accurate description is chosen, e.g., including a detailed chromospheric model\\n(e.g., Vernazza et al., 1981), maintaining a simplified radiative emission and a detailed energy\\nbalance with an ad hoc heat input (Peres et al., 1982; Reale et al., 2000a). Overall, a typical\\nloop initial condition is a hydrostatic atmosphere with a temperature distribution from ∼ 104 K\\nto > 106 K, basically dictated by a thermal conduction profile (Figure 14). The lower boundary\\nof the computational domain is typically not involved in the evolution of the loop plasma. Many\\nloop models assume mirror symmetry with respect to the apex and, therefore, describe only half\\nof the loop. The upper boundary conditions are those of symmetry at the loop apex.\\nThe models also require to define an input heating function (see Section 4.4), specifying its\\ntime-dependence, for instance it can be steady, slowly, or impulsively changing, and its position in\\nspace. The output typically consists of distributions of temperature, density, and velocity along\\nthe loop evolving with time. From simulation results, some modelers derive observables, i.e., the\\nplasma emission, which can be compared directly to data collected with the telescopes. The model\\nresults are, in this case, to be folded with the instrumental response. This forward-modeling\\nallows to obtain constraints on model parameters and, therefore, quantitative information about\\nthe questions to be solved, e.g., the heating rate and location (e.g., Reale et al., 2000a).\\nLoop codes are typically based on finite difference numerical methods. Although they are one-\\ndimensional and, therefore, typically less demanding than other multi-dimensional codes that study\\nsystems with more complex geometry, and although they do not include the explicit description\\nof the magnetic field, as full MHD codes, loop codes require some special care. One of the main\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n36 Fabio Reale\\ndifficulties consists in the appropriate resolution of the steep transition region (1 – 100 km thick)\\nbetween the chromosphere and the corona, which can easily drift up and down depending on\\nthe dynamics of the event to be simulated. The temperature gradient there is very large due\\nto the local balance between the steep temperature dependence of the thermal conduction and\\nthe peak of the radiative losses function (Serio et al., 1981). The density is steep as well so to\\nmaintain the pressure balance. The transition region can become very narrow during flares. An\\ninsufficient resolution of the transition region can lead to inaccurate description of the loop plasma\\ndynamics, e.g., chromospheric evaporation (Bradshaw and Cargill, 2013, see Section 4.1.2). Also a\\nfine temporal resolution is extremely important, because the highly efficient thermal conduction in\\na hot magnetized plasma can lead to a very small time step and make execution times not so small\\neven nowadays. Some deviations can be possible because of non-local thermal conduction that may\\nlengthen considerably the conduction cooling times and may enhance the chances of observing hot\\nnanoflare-heated plasma (West et al., 2008).\\nIn recent years, time-dependent loop modeling has been revived in the light of the observations\\nwith SoHO, TRACE, and SDO for the investigation of the loop dynamics and heating. The\\nupgrade driven by the higher quality of the data has consisted in the introduction of more detailed\\nmechanisms for the heating input, for the momentum deposition, or others, e.g., the time-dependent\\nionization and the saturated thermal conduction (Bradshaw and Cargill, 2006; Reale and Orlando,\\n2008). Some codes have been upgraded to include adaptive mesh refinement for better resolution\\nin regions of high gradients, such as in the transition region, or during impulsive events (e.g., Betta\\net al., 1997). Another form of improvement has been the description of loops as collections of\\nthin strands. Each strand is a self-standing, isolated and independent atmosphere, to be treated\\nexactly as a single loop. This approach has been adopted both to describe loops as static (Reale\\nand Peres, 2000) (Figure 13) and as impulsively heated by nanoflares (Warren et al., 2002). On the\\nsame line, collections of loop models have been applied to describe entire active regions (Warren\\nand Winebarger, 2006).\\n171 A 195 A\\n0 2.5•10-10 5.0•10-10\\n \\nFigure 13: Emission in two TRACE filterbands predicted by a model of loop made by several thin\\nstrands.

This effect can be neglected in many circumstances, but it is becoming\\nincreasingly important with the finer and finer level of diagnostics allowed by upcoming observa-\\ntional data. For instance, the presence of tapering changes considerably the predicted distribution\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 37\\nof emission measure in the low temperature region (Section 4.1.1).\\nPossible deviations from pure 1D evolution might be driven by intense oscillations or kinks,\\nas described in Ofman (2009). The effect of the three-dimensional loop structure should then be\\ntaken into account to describe the interaction with excited MHD waves (McLaughlin and Ofman,\\n2008; Pascoe et al., 2009; Selwa and Ofman, 2009).\\nHowever, the real power of 1D loop models, that makes them still on the edge, is that they\\nfully exploit the property of the confined plasma to evolve as a fluid and practically independent\\nof the magnetic field, and that they can include the coronal part, the transition region, and the\\nphotospheric footpoint in a single model with thermal conduction. In this framework, we may even\\nsimulate a multi-thread structure only by collecting many single loop models together, still with\\nno need to include the description and interaction with the magnetic field (Guarrasi et al., 2010).\\nWe should, however, be aware that the magnetic confinement of the loop material is not as strong\\nand the thermal conduction is not as anisotropic below the coronal part of the loop as it is in the\\ncorona.\\nAn efficient approach to loop modeling is to describe the temporal evolution of average loop\\nquantities (temperature, pressure, and density), i.e., a “0-D” model (Klimchuk et al., 2008; Cargill\\net al., 2012a,b). This model is useful for the description of loops as collections of myriads of\\nindependent strands with a statistical distribution of heating events.\\nAlternative approaches to single or multiple loop modeling have been developed more recently,\\nthanks also to the increasing availability of high performance computing systems and resources.\\nGlobal “ab initio” approaches have been developed (Gudiksen and Nordlund, 2005; Hansteen et al.,\\n2007; see also Yokoyama and Shibata, 2001 for the case of a flare model) to model – with full MHD\\n– boxes of the solar corona that span the entire solar atmosphere from the upper convection zone\\nto the lower corona. These models include non-grey, non-LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium)\\nradiative transport in the photosphere and chromosphere, optically thin radiative losses, as well as\\nmagnetic field-aligned heat conduction in the transition region and corona. Although such models\\nstill cannot resolve well fine structures, such as current sheets and the transition region, they\\ncertainly represent the first important step toward fully self-consistent modeling of the magnetized\\ncorona. Large-scale MHD modeling has been used to explain the appearance of constant cross-\\nsection in EUV observations as due to temperature variations across the loop (Peter and Bingert,\\n2012). Another global model of the solar corona includes also information from photospheric\\nmagnetic field data (Sokolov et al., 2013).\\n4.1.1 Monolithic (static) loops: scaling laws\\nThe Skylab mission remarked, and later missions confirmed (Figure 9), that many X-ray emitting\\ncoronal loops persist mostly unchanged for a time considerably longer than their cooling times by\\nradiation and/or thermal conduction (Rosner et al., 1978, and references therein). This means\\nthat, for most of their lives, they can be well described as systems at equilibrium and has been the\\nstarting point for several early theoretical studies (Landini and Monsignori Fossi, 1975; Gabriel,\\n1976; Jordan, 1976; Vesecky et al., 1979; Jordan, 1980). Rosner et al. (1978) devised a model of\\ncoronal loops in hydrostatic equilibrium with several realistic simplifying assumptions: symmetry\\nwith respect to the apex, constant cross section (see Section 3.2.1), length much shorter than the\\npressure scale height, heat deposited uniformly along the loop, low thermal flux at the base of the\\ntransition region, i.e., the lower boundary of the model. Under these conditions, the pressure is\\nuniform all along the loop, which is then described only by the energy balance between the heat\\ninput and the two main losses mentioned above. From the integration of the equation of energy\\nconservation, one obtains the well-known scaling laws:\\n𝑇0,6 = 1.4 (𝑝𝐿9)\\n1/3\\n(9)\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n38 Fabio Reale\\nand\\n𝐻−3 = 3𝑝7/6𝐿\\n−5/6\\n9 , (10)\\nwhere 𝑇0,6, 𝐿9 and 𝐻−3 are the loop maximum temperature 𝑇0, length 𝐿 and heating rate per unit\\nvolume 𝐻, measured in units of 106 K (MK), 109 cm and 10−3 erg cm−3 s−1 respectively. These\\nscaling laws were found in agreement with Skylab data within a factor 2.\\nAnalogous models were developed in the same framework (Landini and Monsignori Fossi, 1975)\\nand equivalent scaling laws were found independently by Craig et al. (1978) and more general ones\\nby Hood and Priest (1979a). They have been derived with a more general formalism by Bray\\net al. (1991). Although scaling laws could explain several observed properties, some features such\\nas the emission measure in UV lines and the cool loops above sunspots could not be reproduced,\\nand, although the laws have been questioned a number of times (e.g., Kano and Tsuneta, 1995)\\nin front of the acquisition of new data, such as those by Yohkoh and TRACE, they anyhow\\nprovide a basic physical reference frame to interpret any loop feature. For instance, they provide\\nreference equilibrium values even for studies of transient coronal events, they have allowed to\\nconstrain that many loop structures observed with TRACE are overdense (e.g., Lenz et al., 1999;\\nWinebarger et al., 2003a, Section 4.1.2) and, as such, these loops must be cooling from hotter\\nstatus (Winebarger and Warren, 2005, see Section 3.3.3), and so on. They also are useful for\\ndensity estimates when closed with the equation of state, and for coronal energy budget when\\nintegrated on relevant volumes and times.\\nScaling laws have been extended to loops higher than the pressure scale height (Serio et al.,\\n1981), to different heating functions (Martens, 2010), and limited by the finding that very long\\nloops become unstable (Wragg and Priest, 1981). According to Antiochos and Noci (1986), the\\ncool loops belong to a different family and are low-lying, and may eventually explain an evidence\\nof excess of emission measure at low temperature.\\nThe numerical solution of the complete set of hydrostatic equations allowed to obtain detailed\\nprofiles of the physical quantities along the loop, including the steep transition region. Figure 14\\nshows two examples of solution for different values of heating uniformly distributed along the loop.\\nHydrostatic weighting has an effect on the loop visibility and on the vertical temperature\\nstructure of the solar corona (Reale, 1999; Aschwanden and Nitta, 2000). From the comparison\\nof SoHO-CDS observations of active region loops with a static, isobaric loop model (Landini and\\nLandi, 2002), a classical model was not able to reproduce the observations, but ad hoc assumptions\\nare necessary (Brkovic´ et al., 2002; Landi and Landini, 2004). Loop static models were found to\\noverestimate the footpoint emission by orders of magnitude and non-uniformity in the loop cross\\nsection, more specifically a significant decrease of the cross section near the footpoints, was proposed\\nas the most likely solution to the discrepancy (Landi and Feldman, 2004, Section 4.1). On the\\nsame line, loop models with steady uniform heating were compared to X-ray loops and EUV moss\\nin an active region core (Winebarger et al., 2008). A filling factor of 8% and loops that expand\\nwith height provided the best agreement with the intensity in two X-ray filters, though maintaining\\nstill some discrepancies with observations.

In this case, although the loop remains steady on\\naverage for a long time, each strand has a continuously dynamic evolution. The evolution of a loop\\nstructure under the effect of an impulsive heating is well-known and studied from observations\\nand from modeling (e.g., Nagai, 1980; Peres et al., 1982; Cheng et al., 1983; Nagai and Emslie,\\n1984; Fisher et al., 1985a,b,c; MacNeice, 1986; Betta et al., 2001), since it resembles the evolution\\nof single coronal flaring loops. It is worth mentioning here that there have been attempts to\\nmodel even flaring loops as consisting of several flaring strands (Hori et al., 1997, 1998; Reeves and\\nWarren, 2002; Warren, 2006; Reale et al., 2012).\\nThe evolution of single coronal loops or single loop strands subject to impulsive heating was\\nsummarized in the context of the diagnostics of stellar flares (Reale, 2007). A heat pulse injected in\\nan inactive tenuous strand makes chromospheric plasma expand in the coronal section of the strand,\\nand become hot and dense, X-ray bright, coronal plasma. After the end of the heat pulse, the\\nplasma begins to cool slowly. In general, the plasma cooling is governed by the thermal conduction\\nto the cool chromosphere and by radiation from optically thin conditions. In the following, we\\noutline the evolution of the confined heated plasma into four phases, according to Reale (2007).\\nFigure 15 tracks this evolution, which maps on the path drawn in the density-temperature diagram\\nof Figure 16 (see also Jakimiec et al., 1992).\\nFigure 15: Scheme of the evolution of temperature (T, thick solid line), X-ray emission, i.e., the light\\ncurve (LC, thinner solid line) and density (n, dashed line) in a loop strand ignited by a heat pulse.

This\\nevolution changes only slightly if the heat pulse is deposited near the loop footpoints: the\\nconduction front then propagates mainly upwards and on timescales not very different from\\nthe evaporation timescales, also because the heat conduction saturates (e.g., Klimchuk, 2006;\\nReale and Orlando, 2008). In this case the distinction from Phase II is not clearly marked.\\nPhase II: From the temperature peak to the end of the heat pulse (evaporation).

The timescale during this more gradual evaporation is\\ndictated by the time taken by the cooling rate to balance the heat input rate.\\nPhase III: From the end of the heat pulse to the density peak (conductive cooling). When the\\nheat pulse stops, the plasma immediately starts to cool due to the efficient thermal conduction\\n(e.g., Cargill and Klimchuk, 2004), with a timescale (𝑠):\\n𝜏𝑐 =\\n3𝑛𝑐𝑘𝐵𝑇0𝐿\\n2\\n2/7𝜅𝑇\\n7/2\\n0\\n=\\n10.5𝑛𝑐𝑘𝐵𝐿\\n2\\n𝜅𝑇\\n5/2\\n0\\n≈ 1500𝑛9𝐿\\n2\\n9\\n𝑇\\n5/2\\n6\\n, (12)\\nwhere 𝑛𝑐 (𝑛𝑐,9) is the particle density (10\\n9 cm−3) at the end of the heat pulse, the thermal\\nconductivity is 𝜅 = 9×10−7 (c.g.s. units). Since the plasma is dense, we expect no saturation\\neffects in this phase.\\nThe heat stop time can be generally traced as the time at which the temperature begins to de-\\ncrease significantly and monotonically. While the conduction cooling dominates, the plasma\\nevaporation is still going on and the density increasing. The efficiency of radiation cooling\\nincreases as well, while the efficiency of conduction cooling decreases with the temperature.\\nPhase IV: From the density peak afterwards (Radiative cooling). As soon as the radiation cooling\\ntime becomes equal to the conduction cooling time (Cargill and Klimchuk, 2004), the density\\nreaches its maximum, and the loop depletion starts, slowly at first and then progressively\\nfaster. The pressure begins to decrease inside the loop, and is no longer able to sustain\\nthe plasma. The radiation becomes the dominant cooling mechanism, with the following\\ntimescale (𝑠):\\n𝜏𝑟 =\\n3𝑘𝐵𝑇𝑀\\n𝑛𝑀𝑃 (𝑇 )\\n=\\n3𝑘𝐵𝑇𝑀\\n𝑏𝑇𝛼𝑀𝑛𝑀\\n≈ 3000𝑇\\n3/2\\n𝑀,6\\n𝑛𝑀,9\\n, (13)\\nwhere 𝑇𝑀 (𝑇𝑀,6) is the temperature at the time of the density maximum (10\\n6 K), 𝑛𝑀\\n(𝑛𝑀,9) the maximum density (10\\n9 cm−3), and 𝑃 (𝑇 ) the plasma emissivity per unit emission\\nmeasure, expressed as:\\n𝑃 (𝑇 ) = 𝑏𝑇𝛼 ,\\nwith 𝑏 = 1.5 × 10−19 and 𝛼 = −1/2. The density and the temperature both decrease\\nmonotonically.\\nThe presence of significant residual heating could make the decay slower. In single loops, this\\ncan be diagnosed from the analysis of the slope of the decay path in the density-temperature\\ndiagram (Sylwester et al., 1993; Reale et al., 1997a). The free decay has a slope between\\n1.5 and 2 in a log density vs log temperature diagram; heated decay path is flatter down to\\na slope ∼ 0.5. In non-flaring loops, the effect of residual heating can be mimicked by the\\neffect of a strong gravity component, as in long loops perpendicular to the solar surface. The\\ndependence of the decay slope on the pressure scale height has been first studied in Reale\\net al. (1993) and, more recently, in terms of enthalpy flux by Bradshaw and Cargill (2010).\\nAs clear from Figure 16 the path in this phase is totally below, or at most approaches, the\\nQSS curve. This means that for a given temperature value the plasma density is higher than\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n42 Fabio Reale\\nthat expected for an equilibrium loop at that temperature, i.e., the plasma is “overdense”.\\nEvidence of such overdensity (Section 3.3.3) has been taken as an important indication of\\nsteadily pulse-heated loops.\\nFigure 16: Scheme of the evolution of pulse-heated loop plasma of Figure 15 in a density-temperature\\ndiagram (solid line). The four phases are labeled. The locus of the equilibrium loops is shown (dashed-\\ndotted line, marked with QSS), as well as the evolution path with an extremely long heat pulse (dashed\\nline) and the corresponding decay path (marked with EQ).

Important properties\\nof the heated plasma can be obtained from the analysis of the evolution after the heating stops,\\ni.e., when the plasma cools down.\\nSerio et al. (1991) derived a global thermodynamic timescale for the pure cooling of heated\\nplasma confined in single coronal loops, which has been later refined to be (𝑠) (Reale, 2007):\\n𝜏𝑠 = 4.8× 10−4 𝐿√\\n𝑇0\\n= 500\\n𝐿9√︀\\n𝑇0,6\\n. (14)\\nThis decay time was obtained assuming that the decay starts from equilibrium conditions, i.e.,\\ndeparting from the locus of the equilibrium loops with a given length (hereafter QSS line, Jakimiec\\net al., 1992) in Figure 16. It is, therefore, valid as long as there is no considerable contribution\\nfrom the plasma draining to the energy balance. The link between the assumption of equilibrium\\nand the plasma evolution is shown in Figure 16: if the heat pulse lasts long enough, Phase II\\nextends to the right, and the heated loop asymptotically reaches equilibrium conditions, i.e., the\\nhorizontal line approaches the QSS line. If the decay starts from equilibrium conditions, Phase III\\nis no longer present, and Phase II links directly to Phase IV. Therefore, there is no delay between\\nthe beginning of the temperature decay and the beginning of the density decay: the temperature\\nand the density start to decrease simultaneously. Also, the decay will be dominated by radiative\\ncooling, except at the very beginning (Serio et al., 1991).\\nThe presence of Phase III implies a delay between the temperature peak and the density peak.\\nThis delay is often observed both in solar flares (e.g., Sylwester et al., 1993) and in stellar flares\\n(e.g., van den Oord et al., 1988; van den Oord and Mewe, 1989; Favata et al., 2000; Maggio et al.,\\n2000; Stelzer et al., 2002). The presence of this delay, whenever observed, is a signature of a\\nrelatively short heat pulse, or, in other words, of a decay starting from non-equilibrium conditions.\\nAccording to Reale (2007), the time taken by the loop to reach equilibrium conditions under\\nthe action of a constant heating is much longer than the sound crossing time [Eq. (11)], which rules\\nthe very initial plasma evaporation. As already mentioned, in the late rise phase the dynamics\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 43\\nbecome much less important and the interplay between cooling and heating processes becomes\\ndominant. The relevant timescale is therefore that reported in Eq.

Image reproduced\\nwith permission from Reale (2007), copyright by ESO.\\nHydrodynamic simulations confirm that the time required to reach full equilibrium scales as\\nthe loop cooling time (𝜏𝑠) and, as shown for instance in Figure 17 (see also Jakimiec et al., 1992),\\nthe time to reach flare steady-state equilibrium is:\\n𝑡eq ≈ 2.3𝜏𝑠 . (15)\\nFor 𝑡 ≥ 𝑡eq, the density asymptotically approaches the equilibrium value:\\n𝑛0 =\\n𝑇 20\\n2𝑎3𝑘𝐵𝐿\\n= 1.3× 106 𝑇\\n2\\n0\\n𝐿\\n, (16)\\nwhere 𝑎 = 1.4× 103 (c.g.s. units), or\\n𝑛9 = 1.3\\n𝑇 20,6\\n𝐿9\\n. (17)\\nIf the heat pulse stops before the loop reaches equilibrium conditions, the loop plasma maximum\\ndensity is lower than the value at equilibrium, i.e., the plasma is underdense (Cargill and Klimchuk,\\n2004, Section 4.4). Figure 17 shows that, after the initial impulsive evaporation on a timescale given\\nby Eq. (11), the later progressive pressure growth can be approximated with a linear trend. Since\\nthe temperature is almost constant in this phase, we can approximate that the density increases\\nlinearly for most of the time. We can then estimate the value of the maximum density at the loop\\napex as:\\n𝑛𝑀 ≈ 𝑛0 𝑡𝑀\\n𝑡eq\\n, (18)\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n44 Fabio Reale\\nwhere 𝑡𝑀 is the time at which the density maximum occurs.\\nPhase III ranges between the time at which the heat pulse ends and the time of the density\\nmaximum. The latter is also the time at which the decay path crosses the locus of the equilibrium\\nloops (QSS curve). According to Reale (2007), the temperature 𝑇𝑀 at which the maximum density\\noccurs is:\\n𝑇𝑀 = 9× 10−4(𝑛𝑀𝐿)1/2 (19)\\nor\\n𝑇𝑀,6 = 0.9(𝑛𝑀,9𝐿9)\\n1/2 .\\nWe can also derive the duration of Phase III, i.e., the time from the end of the heat pulse to\\nthe density maximum, as\\nΔ𝑡0−𝑀 ≈ 𝜏𝑐 ln𝜓 , (20)\\nwhere\\n𝜓 =\\n𝑇0\\n𝑇𝑀\\nand 𝜏𝑐 [Eq. (12)] is computed for an appropriate value of the density 𝑛𝑐. A good consistency with\\nnumerical simulations is obtained for 𝑛𝑐 = (2/3)𝑛𝑀 .\\nBy combining Eqs. (20) and (18) we obtain:\\nΔ𝑡0−𝑀\\n𝑡𝑀\\n≈ 1.2 ln𝜓 , (21)\\nwhich ranges between 0.2 and 0.8 for typical values of 𝜓 (1.2 – 2).\\nThese scalings are related to the evolution of a single strand under the effect of a local heat\\npulse. The strands are below the current instrument spatial resolution and, therefore, we have to\\nconsider that, if this scenario is valid, we see the envelope of a collection of small scale events.\\nThe characteristics of the single heat pulses become, therefore, even more difficult to diagnose,\\nand the question of their frequency, distribution and size remains open. Also from the point of\\nview of the modeling, a detailed description of a multistrand loop implies a much more complex\\nand demanding effort. A possible approach is to literally build a collection of 1-D loop models,\\neach with an independent evolution (Guarrasi et al., 2010). One common approach so far has\\nbeen to simulate anyhow the evolution of a single strand, and to assume that, in the presence of\\na multitude of such strands, in the steady state we would see at least one strand at any step of\\nthe strand evolution. In other words, a collection of nanoflare-heated strands can be described\\nas a whole with the time-average of the evolution of a single strand (Warren et al., 2002, 2003;\\nWinebarger et al., 2003b,a, see also Section 4.2). Another issue to be explored is whether it is\\npossible, and to what extent, to describe a collection of independently-evolving strands as a single\\neffective evolving loop. For instance, how does the evolution of a single loop where the heating is\\ndecreasing slowly compare to the evolution of a collection of independently heated strands, with\\na decreasing rate of ignition? To what extent do we expect coherence and how is it connected to\\nthe degree of global coherence of the loop heating? Is there any kind of transverse coherence or\\nordered ignition of the strands? It is probably reasonable to describe a multi-stranded loop as a\\nsingle “effective” loop if we can assume that the plasma loses memory of its previous history. This\\ncertainly occurs in late phases of the evolution when the cooling has been going on for a long time.\\n4.2 Fine structuring\\nThe description and role of fine structuring of coronal loops is certainly a challenge for coronal\\nphysics, also on the side of modeling, essentially because we have few constraints from observations\\n(Section 3.2.2). Small-scale structuring is already involved in the magnetic carpet scenario and\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 45\\nflux-tube tectonics model (Priest et al., 2002, see also Section 4.4). One of the first times that\\nthe internal structuring of coronal loops have been invoked in a modeling context was for the\\nproblem of the interpretation of the uniform filter ratio distribution detected with TRACE along\\nwarm loops. Standard models of single hydrostatic loops with uniform heating were soon found\\nto be unable to explain such indication of uniform temperature distribution (Lenz et al., 1999). A\\nuniform filter ratio could be reproduced by the superposition of several thin hydrostatic strands at\\ndifferent temperatures (Reale and Peres, 2000). In alternative, also a model of long loops heated at\\nthe footpoints leads to mostly isothermal loops (Aschwanden, 2001). The problem with this model\\nis that footpoint-heated loops (with heating scale height less than 1/3 of the loop half-length)\\nhad been shown to be thermally unstable (Mendoza-Briceno and Hood, 1997) and, therefore they\\ncannot be long-lived, as instead observed. A further alternative is to explain observations with\\nsteady non-static loops, i.e., with significant flows inside (Winebarger et al., 2001, 2002c, see below).\\nAlso this hypothesis does not seem to answer the question (Patsourakos et al., 2004).\\nA first step to modeling fine-structured loops is to use multistrand static models. Such models\\nshow some substantial inconsistencies with observations, e.g., in general they predict too large loop\\ncross sections (Reale and Peres, 2000). Such strands are conceptually different from the thin strands\\npredicted in the nanoflare scenario (Parker, 1988), which imply a highly dynamic evolution due\\nto pulsed-heating. The nanoflare scenario is approached in multi-thread loop models, convolving\\nthe independent hydrodynamic evolution of the plasma confined in each pulse-heated strand (see\\nSection 4.3). These are able to match some more features of the evolution of warm loops observed\\nwith TRACE (Warren et al., 2002, 2003; Winebarger et al., 2003b,a). According to detailed\\nhydrodynamic loop modeling, an ensemble of independently heated strands can be significantly\\nbrighter than a static uniformly heated loop and would have a flat filter ratio temperature when\\nobserved with TRACE (Warren et al., 2002). As an extension, time-dependent hydrodynamic\\nmodeling of an evolving active region loop observed with TRACE showed that a loop made as\\na set of small-scale, impulsively heated strands can generally reproduce the spatial and temporal\\nproperties of the observed loops, such as a delay between the appearance of the loop in different\\nfilters (Warren et al., 2003). An evolution of this approach was to model an entire active region for\\ncomparison with a SoHO/EIT observation (Warren and Winebarger, 2006); the modeling includes\\nextrapolating the magnetic field and populating the field lines with solutions to the hydrostatic\\nloop equations assuming steady, uniform heating. The result was the link between the heating rate\\nand the magnetic field and size of the structures, but there were also significant discrepancies with\\nthe observed EIT emission.\\nMore recently, modeling a loop system as a collection of thin unresolved strand with pulsed\\nheating has been used to explain why active regions look fuzzier in harder energy bands, i.e. X-\\nrays, and/or hotter spectral lines, e.g., Fexvi, sensitive to high temperatures (∼ 3 MK) (Tripathi\\net al., 2009, Section 3.3.2). Short (∼ 1 min) pulses with flare-like intensity (∼ 10 MK) are able to\\nproduce loops with high filling factors at ∼ 3 MK and lower filling factors at ∼ 1 MK (Guarrasi\\net al., 2010). The basic reason is that in the dynamic evolution of each strand, the plasma spends\\na relatively longer time and with a high emission measure at temperature about 3 MK. The\\nconsequent prediction that loops should show filamented emission for temperature > 3 MK has\\nreceived confirmations by observations of active region cores in the 94 A˚ channel with SDO/AIA\\n(Reale et al., 2011) and in the Caxvii and Fexviii EUV lines (Testa and Reale, 2012), although\\nthe temperature of the emitting plasma is still debated (Teriaca et al., 2012). Low filling factors\\nof warm loops have been predicted also by full MHD modeling (Dahlburg et al., 2012).\\nThe description of loops as bundles of strands applies also to models that include heating by\\nthe dissipation of MHD waves (Alfve´n/ion-cyclotron waves – particles). One such model addressed\\nthe evidence of flat TRACE/EIT filter-ratios along loops that were explained by the multi-filament\\nloop structure (Bourouaine and Marsch, 2010). Transverse oscillations and flows were observed in\\nmulti-stranded loops (Ofman and Wang, 2008; Wang et al., 2012). Multi-stranded loop models\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n46 Fabio Reale\\nwere used in 3D MHD studies of transverse loop oscillations (e.g., Ofman, 2009) and in MHD\\nnormal mode analysis (e.g., Luna et al., 2010).\\nState-of-the-art approaches to the study of multi-stranded loops are based on the concept that\\neach fibril is independent of the others and that the heating is released randomly presumably with\\na power-law distribution. Within the limitations of idealized loop models (without magnetic twist,\\ntime-dependent thread cross-sections, or oscillation), the coronal loops might then be described\\nas self-organized critical systems with no characteristic timescales (e.g., Bak et al., 1989; Lu and\\nHamilton, 1991; Charbonneau et al., 2001). This model has had a practical realization specific to\\nreproduce soft X-ray steady-state loops (Lo´pez Fuentes and Klimchuk, 2010) and is able to repro-\\nduced the loop light curves observed, for instance, with GOES/SXI. Another interesting approach\\nis to use artificial neural networks (Tajfirouze and Safari, 2012) as mentioned in Section 3.4.\\n4.3 Flows\\nA generalization of static models of loops (Section 4.1.1) is represented by models of loops with\\nstationary flows, driven by a pressure imbalance between the footpoints (siphon flows). The prop-\\nerties of siphon flows have been studied by several authors (Cargill and Priest, 1980; Priest, 1981;\\nNoci, 1981; Borrini and Noci, 1982; Antiochos, 1984; Thomas, 1988; Montesinos and Thomas, 1989;\\nNoci et al., 1989; Thomas and Montesinos, 1990; Spadaro et al., 1990; Thomas and Montesinos,\\n1991; Peres et al., 1992; Montesinos and Thomas, 1993). A complete detailed model of loop siphon\\nflows was developed and used to explore the space of the solutions and to derive an extension of\\nRTV scaling laws to loops containing subsonic flows (Orlando et al., 1995b).\\nCritical and supersonic flows create the conditions for the presence of stationary shocks in\\ncoronal loops (Figure 18). The shock position depends on the volumetric heating rate of the loop\\n(Orlando et al., 1995a). The presence of massive flows may alter the line emission with respect to\\nstatic plasma, because of the delay of the moving plasma to settle to ionization equilibrium (Golub\\nand Herant, 1989). Including the effect of ionization non-equilibrium, the UV lines are predicted\\nto be blue-shifted by loop models (Spadaro et al., 1990). So non-equilibrium emission from flows\\ncannot explain the observed dominant redshifts (Section 3.5). Non-equilibrium of ionization in UV\\nline emission can be driven by shocked siphon flows (Orlando and Peres, 1999) and by reconnection\\nflows (Imada et al., 2011).\\nIn the 1990s, modeling efforts were devoted to explain specifically the extensive evidence of\\nred-shifted UV lines on the solar disk. A hydrodynamic loop model including the effects of non-\\nequilibrium of ionization showed that the redshifts might be produced by downward propagating\\nacoustic waves, possibly stimulated by nanoflares (Hansteen, 1993). Two-dimensional hydrody-\\nnamic simulations showed that the UV redshifts might be produced by downdrafts driven by\\nradiatively-cooling condensations in the solar transition region (Reale et al., 1996, 1997b). Pre-\\ndicted redshifts range from those typical of quiet Sun to active regions and may occur more easily\\nin the higher pressure plasma, typical of active regions.\\nExplosions below the corona were explored to drive flows (Teriaca et al., 1999; Sarro et al., 1999)\\nin magnetic loops around the Ovi and C iv formation temperature. The observed redshift of mid-\\nlow transition region lines as well as the blueshift observed in low coronal lines (𝑇 > 6 × 105 K)\\nwere compared to numerical simulations of the response of the solar atmosphere to an energy\\nperturbation of 4 × 1024 erg, including non-equilibrium of ionization (Teriaca et al., 1999). Per-\\nforming an integration over the entire period of simulations, they found a redshift in C iv, and\\na blueshift in Ovi and Neviii, of a few km s–1, in reasonable agreement with observations. A\\nsimilar idea was applied to make predictions about the presence or absence of non-thermal broad-\\nening in several spectral lines (e.g., Neviii, Mgx, Fexvii) due to nanoflare-driven chromospheric\\nevaporation (Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2006). Clearly, the occurrence of such effects in the lines\\ndepends considerably on the choice of the heat pulse parameters.

In other words, modeling should address specific\\nobservations to provide more conclusive results.\\nTheoretical reasons indicate that flows should be invariably present in coronal loop systems,\\nalthough they may not be necessarily important in the global loop momentum and energy budget.\\nFor instance, it has been shown that the presence of at least moderate flows is necessary to explain\\nwhy we actually see the loops (Lenz, 2004). The loop emission and detection is in fact due to the\\nemission from heavy ions, like Fe. In hydrostatic equilibrium conditions, gravitational settlement\\nshould keep the emitting elements low on the solar surface, and we should not be able to see\\nbut the loop footpoints. Instead, detailed modeling shows that flows of few km s–1 are enough\\nto drag ions high in the corona by Coulomb coupling and to enhance coronal ion abundances by\\norders of magnitudes. Incidentally, the same modeling shows that, for the same mechanisms, no\\nchemical fractionation of coronal plasma with respect to photospheric composition as a function\\nof the element first ionization potential (FIP) should be present in coronal loops.\\nOther studies address instead the relative unimportance of flows in coronal loops. In partic-\\nular, as already mentioned in Section 3.2.2, steady hydrodynamic loop modeling (i.e., assuming\\nequilibrium condition and, therefore, dropping the time-dependent terms in Eqs. (4), (5), and (6)),\\nshowed that flows may not be able to explain the evidence of isothermal loops (Patsourakos et al.,\\n2004), as instead proposed by Winebarger et al. (2002c). Flows are able to enhance its density\\nto the levels typically diagnosed from TRACE observations, but they also produce an inversion of\\nthe temperature distribution and a structured filter ratio, not observed.\\nPlasma cooling is a mechanism that may drive significant downflows in a loop (e.g., Bradshaw\\nand Cargill, 2005, 2010). Catastrophic cooling in loops (Mu¨ller et al., 2004, 2005) was proposed\\nto explain the evidence of propagating intensity variations observed in the He ii 304 A˚ line with\\nSoHO/EIT (De Groof et al., 2004, Section 3.5). Two possible driving mechanisms had been\\nproposed: slow magnetoacoustic waves or blobs of cool downfalling plasma. A model of cool\\ndownfalling blob triggered in a thermally-unstable loop heated at the footpoints gave a qualitative\\nagreement with measured speeds and predicted a significant braking in the high-pressure transition\\nregion, to be checked in future high cadence observations in cool lines.\\nPlasma waves have been more recently proposed to have an important role in driving flows\\nwithin loops. Acoustic waves excited by heat pulses at the chromospheric loop footpoints and\\ndamped by thermal conduction in corona are possible candidates (Taroyan et al., 2005). Even\\nmore attention received the propagation of Alfve´n waves in coronal loops. Hydrodynamic loop\\nmodeling showed that Alfve´n waves deposit significant momentum in the plasma, and that steady\\nstate conditions with significant flows and relatively high density can be reached (O’Neill and Li,\\n2005). Analogous results were obtained independently with a different approach: considering a\\nwind-like model to describe a long isothermal loop, Grappin et al. (2003, 2005) showed that the\\nwaves can drive pressure variations along the loop which trigger siphon flows. Alfve´n disturbances\\nhave been more recently shown to be amplified by the presence of loop flows (Taroyan, 2009).\\nLarge-scale MHD models have also addressed the presence of flows in the low corona. These\\nmodels show that heat pulses released low in the corona in places of strong magnetic field braiding\\ntrigger downflows and slight upflows (Figure 19, Hansteen et al., 2010; Zacharias et al., 2011). The\\ncorresponding Doppler-shifts are similar to those often observed (see Section 3.5). Most of the mass\\ncirculating across the transition region is probably confined in very short loops (∼ 2 × 108 cm)\\n(Guerreiro et al., 2013).\\nLarge-scale chromospheric upflows (type-II spicules, see Section 3.5) are explored as viable\\nmechanisms of mass and energy supply to coronal loops with loop modeling (Judge et al., 2012).\\nHowever, theoretical estimates suggest that a corona dominated by this scenario would lead to\\nlarge discrepancies with observations, therefore confining the possible action of this mechanism in\\na limited number of structures (Klimchuk, 2012).\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 49\\nFigure 19: Maps of intensity (left), Doppler shift (middle) and line width (right) in the C iv line in a 3-D\\nMHD simulation of a box of the upper solar atmosphere.

Although the magnetic origin of coronal heating has been\\nwell-established since the very first X-ray observations of the corona, the detailed mechanism of\\nconversion of magnetic energy into thermal energy is still under intense debate, because a series of\\nphysical effects conspire to make the mechanism intrinsically elusive.\\nKlimchuk (2006) splits the heating problem into six steps: the identification of the source of\\nenergy, its conversion into heat, the plasma response to the heating, the spectrum of the emitted\\nradiation, the final signature in observables. Outside of analytical approaches, the source and\\nconversion of energy are typically studied in detail by means of multi-dimensional full MHD models\\n(e.g., Gudiksen and Nordlund, 2005), which, however, are still not able to provide exhaustive\\npredictions on the plasma response and complete diagnostics on observables. On the other hand,\\nthe plasma response is the main target of loop hydrodynamic models, which, instead, are not able\\nto treat the heating problem in a self-consistent way (Section 4.1).\\nIn the investigation of the source of energy, the magnetic field plays an active role in heating\\nthe coronal loops (Golub et al., 1980). The observation of a magnetic carpet (Schrijver et al., 1998)\\nsuggests that current sheets at the boundary of the carpet cells can dissipate and heat the corona,\\nacting in analogy to geophysical plate tectonics (Priest et al., 2002). A common scenario is that\\nthe field lines are wound continuously by the photospheric convective motions and the generated\\nnon-potential component is dissipated into heating. Several studies were devoted to the connection\\nand scaling of the magnetic energy to the coronal energy content (Golub et al., 1982) and to the\\nrate of energy release through reconnection (Galeev et al., 1981).\\nIt is known that twisted loops can become kink unstable above a critical twist; however, accord-\\ning to Parker (1988), as soon as the magnetic field lines are tangled at an angle of ∼ 15∘, enough\\nmagnetic energy can be released to power a loop by rapid reconnection across the spontaneous\\ntangential discontinuities. The dissipation destroys the cross-component of the magnetic field as\\nrapidly as it is produced by the motion of the footpoints, reaching a steady state. The twisting of\\ncoronal loops has been studied in the framework of kink instability (Hood and Priest, 1979b; Velli\\net al., 1990) with resistive effects (Baty, 2000), of loop cross-section (Klimchuk, 2000), of flux emer-\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n50 Fabio Reale\\ngence (Hood et al., 2009a), of cellular automaton loop modeling (Lo´pez Fuentes and Klimchuk,\\n2010), and in connection with transverse oscillations (Ofman, 2009). Loop twisting or braiding and\\nkink instability can lead to magnetic reconnection with the formation and fragmentation of thin\\ncurrent sheets and their dissipation through resistivity (Hood et al., 2009b; Wilmot-Smith et al.,\\n2010; Bareford et al., 2010; Pontin et al., 2011; Wilmot-Smith et al., 2011; Bareford et al., 2011,\\n2013).\\nThe comparison of TRACE and Hinode time sequences of active region loops with magnetic\\nfield reconstruction models have allowed to measure the changes in the magnetic topology and\\nenergy with the time. A high variability corresponds to a high number of magnetic separation\\nlines (Priest et al., 2002) where the energy can be released in short timescales (Lee et al., 2010).\\nA model of nonlinear force-free field traced that magnetic energy is built up in the core of active\\nregions by small-scale photospheric motions (Mackay et al., 2011). The photospheric motions are\\ntherefore the ultimate energy source and stress the field or generate waves depending on whether\\nthe timescale of the motion is long or short compared to the end-to-end Alfve´n travel time.\\nFollowing Klimchuk (2006), dissipation of magnetic stresses can be referred to as direct current\\n(DC) heating, and dissipation of waves as alternating current (AC) heating.\\nThe question of the conversion of the magnetic energy into heat is also challenging, because\\ndissipation is predicted to occur on very small scales or large gradients in the corona by classical\\ntheory, although there are some indications of anomalously high dissipation coefficients (Martens\\net al., 1985; Nakariakov et al., 1999; Fuentes-Ferna´ndez et al., 2012). As reviewed by Klimchuk\\n(2006), large gradients may be produced in various ways, involving either magnetic field patterns\\nand their evolution, magnetic instabilities such as the kink instability, or velocity pattern, such as\\nturbulence. For waves, resonance absorption and phase mixing may be additional viable mecha-\\nnisms (see Section 4.4.2).\\nThe problem of plasma response to heating has been kept historically well separated from the\\nprimary heating origin, although some attempts have been made to couple them. For instance, in\\nReale et al. (2005) the time-dependent distribution of energy dissipation along the loop obtained\\nfrom a hybrid shell model was used as heating input of a time-dependent hydrodynamic loop model\\n(see below). A similar concept was applied to search for signatures of turbulent heating in UV\\nspectral lines (Parenti et al., 2006).\\nAs already mentioned, studies using steady-state or time-dependent purely hydrodynamic loop\\nmodeling have addressed primarily the plasma response to heating, and also its radiative emission\\nand the detailed comparison with observations. A forward-modeling including all these steps\\nwas performed on a TRACE observation of a brightening coronal loop (Reale et al., 2000a,b,\\nsee also Section 3.4). The analysis was used to set up the parameters for the forward modeling,\\nand to run loop hydrodynamic simulations with various assumptions on the heating location and\\ntime dependence. The comparison of the TRACE emission predicted by the simulations with the\\nmeasured one constrained the heat pulse to be short, much less than the observed loop rise phase,\\nand intense, appropriate for a 3 MK loop, and its location to be probably midway between the\\napex and one of the footpoints.\\nThe investigation of the heating mechanisms through the plasma response is difficult for a\\nvariety of reasons. For instance, the problem of background subtraction can be crucial in the\\ncomparison with observations, as shown by the three analyses of the same large loop structure\\nobserved with Yohkoh/SXT on the solar limb, mentioned in Section 3.3. More specifically, Priest\\net al. (2000) tried to deduce the form of the heating from Yohkoh observed temperature profiles\\nand found that a uniform heating best describes the data, if the temperature is obtained from the\\nratio of the total filter intensities, with no background subtraction. Aschwanden (2001) split the\\nmeasured emission into two components and found a better agreement with heating deposited at\\nthe loop footpoints. Reale (2002b) revisited the analysis of the same loop system, considering con-\\nventional hydrostatic single-loop models and accounting accurately for an unstructured background\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 51\\ncontribution. With forward-modeling, i.e., synthesizing from the model observable quantities to be\\ncompared directly with the data, background-subtracted data are fitted with acceptable statistical\\nsignificance by a model of relatively hot loop (∼ 3.7 MK) heated at the apex, but it was pointed\\nout the importance of background subtraction and the necessity of more specialized observations\\nto address this question. More diagnostic techniques to compare models with observations were\\nproposed afterwards (e.g., Landi and Landini, 2005).\\nIndependently of the adopted numerical or theoretical tool, many studies have been addressing\\nthe mechanisms of coronal loop heating clearly distinguishing between the two main classes, i.e.,\\nDC heating through moderate and frequent explosive events, named nanoflares (e.g., Parker, 1988)\\nand AC heating via Alfve´n waves (e.g., Litwin and Rosner, 1998).\\n4.4.1 DC heating\\nHeating by nanoflares has a long history as a possible candidate to explain the heating of the\\nsolar corona, and, in particular, of the coronal loops (e.g., Peres et al., 1993; Cargill, 1993; Kopp\\nand Poletto, 1993; Shimizu, 1995; Judge et al., 1998; Mitra-Kraev and Benz, 2001; Katsukawa\\nand Tsuneta, 2001; Mendoza-Bricen˜o et al., 2002; Warren et al., 2002, 2003; Spadaro et al., 2003;\\nCargill and Klimchuk, 1997, 2004; Mu¨ller et al., 2004; Testa et al., 2005; Reale et al., 2005; Taroyan\\net al., 2006; Vekstein, 2009). The coronal tectonics model (Priest et al., 2002) is an updated version\\nof Parker’s nanoflare theory, for which the motions of photospheric footpoints continually build\\nup current sheets along the separatrix boundaries of the flux coming from each microscopic source\\n(Priest, 2011).\\nModels of loops made of thousands of nanoflare-heated strands were developed and applied to\\nderive detailed predictions (Cargill, 1994). In particular, whereas the loop total emission measure\\ndistribution should steepen above the canonical 𝑇 1.5 (Jordan, 1980; Orlando et al., 2000; Peres\\net al., 2001) dependence for temperature above 1 MK. Moreover, it was stressed the importance\\nof the dependence of effects such as the plasma dynamics (filling and draining) on the loop filling\\nfactor driven by the elemental heat pulse size (Section 4.1.2). The nanoflare model was early\\napplied to the heating of coronal loops observed by Yohkoh (Cargill and Klimchuk, 1997). A\\ngood match was found only for hot (4 MK) loops, with filling factors less than 0.1, so that it was\\nhypothesized the existence of two distinct classes of hot loops.\\nAlthough there is evidence of intermittent heating episodes, it has been questioned whether and\\nto what extent nanoflares are able to provide enough energy to heat the corona (e.g., Aschwanden,\\n1999). On the other hand, loop models with nanoflares, and, in particular, those considering a\\nprescribed random time distribution of the pulses deposited at the footpoints of multi-stranded\\nloops have been able to explain several features of loop observations, for instance, of warm loops\\nfrom TRACE (Warren et al., 2002, 2003, see Section 3.2.2).\\nHydrodynamic loop modeling showed also that different distributions of the heat pulses along\\nthe loop have limited effects on the observable quantities (Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2005), be-\\ncause most of the differences occur at the beginning of the heat deposition, when the emission\\nmeasure is low, while later the loop loses memory of the heat distribution (see also Winebarger\\nand Warren, 2004). An application of both static and impulsive models to solar active regions\\nshowed that the latter ones are able to simultaneously reproduce EUV and SXR loops in active\\nregions, and to predict radial intensity variations consistent with the localized core and extended\\nemissions (Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2008). As a further improvement, the simulation of an\\nentire active region with an impulsive heating model reproduced the total observed soft X-ray\\nemission in all of the Yohkoh/SXT filters (Warren and Winebarger, 2007). However, once again,\\nat EUV wavelengths the agreement between the simulation and the observation was only partial.\\nNanoflares have been studied also in the framework of stellar coronae. Intermittent heating\\nby relatively intense nanoflares deposited at the loop footpoints makes the loop stable on long\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n52 Fabio Reale\\ntimescales (Testa et al., 2005; Mendoza-Bricen˜o et al., 2005) (loops infrequently heated at the\\nfootpoints are unstable) and, on the other hand, produces a well-defined peak in the average DEM\\nof the loop, similar to that derived from the DEM reconstruction of active stars (Cargill, 1994;\\nTesta et al., 2005). Therefore, this is an alternative way to obtain a steep temperature dependence\\nof the loop emission measure distribution in the low temperature range.\\nAn alternative approach to study nanoflare heating is to analyze intensity fluctuations (Shimizu\\nand Tsuneta, 1997; Vekstein and Katsukawa, 2000; Katsukawa and Tsuneta, 2001; Vekstein and\\nJain, 2003) and to derive their occurrence distribution (Sakamoto et al., 2008, 2009). From the\\nwidth of the distributions and autocorrelation functions, it has been suggested that nanoflare signa-\\ntures are more easily found in observations of warm TRACE loops than of hot Yohkoh/SXT loops.\\nIt is to be investigated whether the results change after relaxing the assumption of temperature-\\nindependent distribution widths. Also other variability analysis of TRACE observations was found\\nable to put constraints on loop heating. In particular, in TRACE observations, the lack of ob-\\nservable warm loops and of significant variations in the moss regions implies that the heating in\\nthe hot moss loops should not be truly flare-like, but instead quasi-steady and that the heating\\nmagnitude is only weakly varying (Antiochos et al., 2003; Warren et al., 2010b).\\nAn analogous approach is to analyze the intensity distributions. The distribution of impulsive\\nevents vs their number in the solar and stellar corona is typically described with a power law. The\\nslope of the power law is a critical parameter to establish weather such events are able to heat\\nthe solar corona (Hudson, 1991). In particular, a power law index of 2 is the critical value above\\nor below which flare-like events may be able or unable, respectively, to power the whole corona\\n(e.g., Aschwanden, 1999; Bareford et al., 2010; Tajfirouze and Safari, 2012). Unfortunately, due\\nto the faintness of the events, the distribution of weak events is particularly difficult to derive\\nand might even be separate from that of proper flares and microflares. A hydrodynamic model\\nwas used to simulate the UV emission of a loop system heated by nanoflares on small, spatially\\nunresolved scales (Parenti and Young, 2008). The simulations confirmed previous results that\\nseveral spectral lines have an intensity distribution that follows a power-law, in a similar way to\\nthe heating function (Hudson, 1991). However, only the high temperature lines best preserve the\\nheating function’s power law index (especially Fexix).\\nThe shape of the emission measure distribution is, in principle, a powerful tool to constrain\\nthe heating mechanisms. The width in temperature provides information about the temporal\\ndistribution of a discontinuous heating mechanism: for a broad (multi-thermal) distribution the\\nsimultaneous presence of many temperature components along the line of sight may be produced\\nby many strands randomly heated for a short time and then spending most of the time in the\\ncooling, thus “crossing” many different temperatures. A peaked distribution, i.e., plasma closer\\nto an isothermal condition, indicates a plasma sustained longer at a certain temperature, with a\\nheating much more uniform in time than for multi-thermal loops. A semi-analytical loop model\\nof a cycling heating/cooling (Cargill and Klimchuk, 2004) naturally led to hot-underdense/warm-\\noverdense loop (Section 4.1.2), as observed (Winebarger et al., 2003b, Section 3.3.3), and showed\\nthat the width of the DEM of a nanoflare-heated loop can depend on the number of strands which\\ncompose the loop: a relatively flat DEM or a peaked (isothermal) DEM are obtained with strands\\nof diameter about 15 km or about 150 km, respectively. This is of relevance for the diagnostics both\\nof the loop fine structure (Section 3.2.2) and of the DEM reconstruction (Section 3.3). In general,\\na broad emission measure distribution would be a signature of a low-frequency heating, whereas a\\npeaked distribution would be a signature of high-frequency heating (Warren et al., 2010b; Susino\\net al., 2010). The timescale is basically dictated by the cooling times. High frequency heating seems\\nto explain several debated evidence in warm loops of active regions, i.e., loop lifetime, high density,\\nand the narrow differential emission measure, but not the higher temperature loops detected in\\nthe X-rays (Warren et al., 2010a). It is remarked that overdense plasma would be emphasized also\\nby deviations from equilibrium of ionization due to impulsive heating (Bradshaw and Klimchuk,\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 53\\n2011), and that the predicted cool side of the emission measure distribution might steepen using\\nupdated radiative losses (Reale et al., 2012). However, the constraints on heating from emission\\nmeasure distribution are largely debated; broad and peaked emission measure distributions of hot\\n3 MK loops might be compatible with steady heating models (Winebarger et al., 2011). This\\ndebate has been specifically addressed and all evidence has been collected and analysed through\\nloop modeling. In particular, the consistency of the DEM slopes on the cool side with low frequency\\nnanoflare heating has been tested. It has been found that, although heating by single pulses might\\nexplain the majority of DEMs derived in the literature (Bradshaw et al., 2012) and that trains\\nof nanoflares might explain practically all of them (Reep et al., 2013), the uncertainties in the\\ndata analysis and DEM reconstruction are too large reach conclusive answers. Radiative losses are\\nimportant to the existence of small and cool loops (height ≤ 8 Mm, T ≤ 105 K) that determine\\nthe cool side of the emission measure distribution (Sasso et al., 2012).\\nSupport to dynamic heating comes from modeling loops with steady heating located at the\\nfootpoints. It is known that such heating is not able to keep loop atmosphere in steady equilibrium\\nbecause they are thermally unstable (Antiochos and Klimchuk, 1991; Antiochos et al., 1999; Mu¨ller\\net al., 2004; Karpen and Antiochos, 2008; Mok et al., 2008). Catastrophic cooling occurs along the\\nloops some time after the heating is switched on and might explain deviations from hydrostatic\\nequilibrium, and some features of the light curves measured in the EUV band (Peter et al., 2012).\\nHowever, the timescales required by this scenario seem too long compared to the measured loop\\nlifetimes (Klimchuk et al., 2010).\\n4.4.2 AC heating\\nLoop oscillations, modes and wave propagation deserve a review by themselves, and are outside\\nof the scope of the present one. Here we account for some aspects which are relevant for the loop\\nheating. A review of coronal waves and oscillations can be found in Nakariakov and Verwichte\\n(2005). New observations from SDO AIA provide ample evidence of wave activity in the solar\\ncorona (Title, 2010), as reported on in Section 3.5.2.\\nAs reviewed by Klimchuk (2006), MHD waves of many types are generated in the photosphere,\\ne.g., acoustic, Alfve´n, fast and slow magnetosonic waves. Propagating upwards, the waves may\\ntransfer energy to the coronal part of the loops. The question is what fraction of the wave flux\\nis able to pass through the very steep density and temperature gradients in the transition region.\\nAcoustic and slow-mode waves form shocks and are strongly damped, fast-mode waves are strongly\\nrefracted and reflected (Narain and Ulmschneider, 1996).\\nIonson (1978, 1982, 1983) devised an LRC equivalent circuit to show the potential importance\\nof AC processes to heat the corona. Hollweg (1984) used a dissipation length formalism to propose\\nresonance absorption of Alfve´n waves as a potential coronal heating mechanism. A loop may be\\nconsidered as a high-quality resonance cavity for hydromagnetic waves. Turbulent photospheric\\nmotions can excite small-scale waves. Most Alfve´n waves are strongly reflected in the chromosphere\\nand transition region, where the Alfve´n speed increases dramatically with height. Significant\\ntransmission is possible only within narrow frequency bands centered on discrete values where\\nloop resonance conditions are satisfied (Hollweg, 1981, 1984; Ionson, 1982). The waves resonate\\nas a global mode and dissipate efficiently when their frequency is near the local Alfve´n waves\\nfrequency 𝜔𝐴 ≈ 2𝜋𝑣𝐴/𝐿. By solving the linearized MHD equations, Davila (1987) showed that\\nthis mechanism can potentially heat the corona, as further supported by numerical solution of\\nMHD equations for low beta plasma (Steinolfson and Davila, 1993), and although Parker (1991)\\nargued that Alfve´n waves are difficult to be generated by solar convection.\\nHollweg (1985) estimated that enough flux may pass through the base of long (> 1010 cm) ac-\\ntive region loops to provide their heating, but shorter loops are a problem, since they have higher\\nresonance frequencies and the photospheric power spectrum is believed to decrease exponentially\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n54 Fabio Reale\\nwith frequency in this range. Litwin and Rosner (1998) suggested that short loops may transmit\\nwaves with low frequencies, as long as the field is sufficiently twisted. Hollweg and Yang (1988)\\nproposed that Alfve´n resonance can pump energy out of the surface wave into thin layers surround-\\ning the resonant field lines and that the energy can be distributed by an eddy viscosity throughout\\nlarge portions of coronal active region loops.\\nWaves may be generated directly in the corona, and some evidence was found (e.g., Nakariakov\\net al., 1999; Aschwanden et al., 1999a; Berghmans and Clette, 1999; De Moortel et al., 2002). It\\nis unclear whether coronal waves carry a sufficient energy flux to heat the plasma (Tomczyk et al.,\\n2007). Ofman et al. (1995) studied the dependence on the wavenumber for comparison with obser-\\nvations of loop oscillations and found partial agreement with velocity amplitudes measured from\\nnon-thermal broadening of soft X-ray lines. The observed non-thermal broadening of transition\\nregion and coronal spectral lines implies fluxes that may be sufficient to heat both the quiet Sun\\nand active regions, but it is unclear whether the waves are efficiently dissipated (Porter et al.,\\n1994). Furthermore, the non-thermal line broadening could be produced by unresolved loop flows\\nthat are unrelated to waves (e.g., Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2006). Ofman et al. (1998) included\\ninhomogeneous density structure and found that a broadband wave spectrum becomes necessary\\nfor efficient resonance and that it fragments the loop into many density layers that resemble the\\nmultistrand concept. The heat deposition by the resonance of Alfve´n waves in a loop was in-\\nvestigated by O’Neill and Li (2005). A multi-strand loop model where the heating is due to the\\ndissipation of MHD waves was applied to explain filter-ratios along loops (Bourouaine and Marsch,\\n2010, see Sections 3.3.3, 4.2). By assuming a functional form first proposed by Hollweg (1986),\\nhydrodynamic loop modeling showed that, depending on the model parameters, heating by Alfve´n\\nwaves leads to different classes of loop solutions, such as the isothermal cool loops indicated by\\nTRACE, or the hot loops observed with Yohkoh/SXT. Specific diagnostics are still to be defined\\nfor the comparison with observations.\\nEfficient wave dissipation may be allowed by enhanced dissipation coefficients inferred from fast\\ndamping of flaring loop oscillations in the corona (Nakariakov et al., 1999), but the same effect\\nmay also favor efficient magnetic reconnection in nanoflares. Alfve´n waves required for resonant\\nabsorption are relatively high frequency waves. Evidence for lower frequency Alfve´n waves has\\nbeen found in the chromosphere with the Hinode SOT (De Pontieu et al., 2007b). Such waves may\\nsupply energy in the corona even outside of resonance with different mechanisms to be explored with\\nmodeling. Among dissipation mechanisms phase mixing with enhanced resistivity was suggested\\nby Ofman and Aschwanden (2002) and supported by the analysis of Ofman and Wang (2008). Also\\nmultistrand structure has been recognized to be important in possible wave dissipation and loop\\ntwisting (Ofman, 2009). Long-period (> 10 s) chromospheric kink waves might propagate into the\\ncorona by transformation into Alfve´n waves and be dissipated there (Soler et al., 2012).\\nIn the more general context of coronal heating, after several previous works, follow-up modeling\\nand analytical effort has been devoted to the dissipation of Alfven waves through phase mixing (e.g.,\\nHeyvaerts and Priest, 1983; Nakariakov et al., 1997; Botha et al., 2000; Ofman and Aschwanden,\\n2002) and ponderomotive force (Verwichte et al., 1999) in a nonideal inhomogeneous medium,\\nfinding effects on very long timescales (> 1 month, McLaughlin et al., 2011).\\nIntensity disturbances propagating along active region loops at speeds above 100 km s–1 were\\ndetected with TRACE and interpreted as slow magnetosonic waves (Nakariakov et al., 2000). These\\nwaves probably originate from the underlying oscillations, i.e., the 3-minute\\nchromospheric/ transition-region oscillations in sunspots and the 5-minute solar global oscillations\\n(p-modes). Slow magnetosonic waves might be good candidates as coronal heating sources ac-\\ncording to a detailed model, including the effect of chromosphere and transition region and of the\\nradiative losses in the corona (Belie¨n et al., 1999). Such waves might be generated directly from\\nupward propagating Alfve´n waves. Contrary conclusions, in favor of fast magnetosonic waves, have\\nbeen also obtained, but with much simpler modeling (Peku¨nlu¨ et al., 2001). Slow magnetosonic\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 55\\nwaves with periods of about 5 minutes have been more recently detected in the transition region\\nand coronal emission lines by Hinode/EIS at the footpoint of a coronal loop rooted at plage, but\\nfound to carry not enough energy to heat the corona (Wang et al., 2009). Slow magnetosonic waves\\nmight be coupled to upflows and produced by impulsive events at the base of active region loops\\n(Ofman et al., 2012).\\nInvestigation of AC heating has been made also through comparison with DC heating. Antolin\\net al. (2008) compared observational signatures of coronal heating by Alfve´n waves and nanoflares\\nusing two coronal loop models and found that Hinode XRT intensity histograms display power-\\nlaw distributions whose indices differ considerably, to be checked against observations. Lundquist\\net al. (2008a,b) applied a method for predicting active region coronal emissions using magnetic\\nfield measurements and a chosen heating relationship to 10 active regions. With their forward-\\nmodeling, they found a volumetric coronal heating rate proportional to magnetic field and inversely\\nproportional to field-line loop length, which seems to point to, although not conclusively, the steady-\\nstate scaling of two heating mechanisms: van Ballegooijen’s current layers theory (van Ballegooijen,\\n1986), taken in the AC limit, and Parker’s critical angle mechanism (Parker, 1988), in the case\\nwhere the angle of misalignment is a twist angle. As interesting points of contacts with the models\\nof impulsive heating, it has been proposed that loops can be heated impulsively by Alfve´n waves\\ndissipated on reasonable timescales through turbulent cascade that develops when the waves are\\ntransmitted from the photosphere to the corona (van Ballegooijen et al., 2011; Asgari-Targhi et al.,\\n2013), using reduced MHD equations.\\n4.5 Large-scale modeling\\nCoronal loops have been studied also with models that include the magnetic field. We can distin-\\nguish several levels of treatment of the magnetic effects. One basic level is to use global scalings\\nto discriminate between different heating mechanisms. Based on a previous study of the plasma\\nparameters and the magnetic flux density (Mandrini et al., 2000), De´moulin et al. (2003) derived\\nthe dependence of the mean coronal heating rate on the magnetic flux density from the analysis of\\nan active region. By using the scaling laws of coronal loops, they found that models based on the\\ndissipation of stressed, current-carrying magnetic fields are in better agreement with the observa-\\ntions than models that attribute coronal heating to the dissipation of MHD waves injected at the\\nbase of the corona. A similar approach was applied to the whole corona, by populating magnetic\\nfield lines taken from observed magnetograms with quasi-static loop atmospheres (Schrijver et al.,\\n2004). The best match to X-ray and EUV observation was obtained with a heating that scales as\\nexpected from DC reconnection at tangential discontinuities.\\nLarge-scale modeling has been able to explain the ignition of warm loops from primary energy\\nrelease mechanisms. A large-scale approach (see also Section 4.1) is by “ab initio” modeling, i.e.,\\nwith full MHD modeling of an entire coronal region (Gudiksen and Nordlund, 2005; Gudiksen\\net al., 2011). Observed solar granular velocity pattern, a potential extrapolation of a SoHO/MDI\\nmagnetogram, and a standard stratified atmosphere are used as initial conditions. The first simula-\\ntions showed that, at steady state, the magnetic field is able to dissipate (3 – 4)×106 erg cm−2 s−1\\nin a highly intermittent corona, at an average temperature of ∼ 106 K, adequate to reproduce\\ntypical warm loop populations observed in TRACE images. Warm loops were also obtained with\\ntime-dependent loop modeling including the intermittent magnetic dissipation in MHD turbulence\\ndue to loop footpoint motions (Reale et al., 2005). The dissipation rate along a loop predicted\\nwith a hybrid-shell model (Nigro et al., 2004) was used as heating input [see Eq. (6)] in a proper\\ntime-dependent loop model, the Palermo-Harvard code (Peres et al., 1982). It was shown that the\\nmost intense nanoflares excited in an ambient magnetic field of about 10 G can produce warm\\nloops with temperatures of 1 – 1.5 MK in the corona of a 30 000 km long loop.\\nMore recently, reduced MHD (rMHD) was used to identify MHD anisotropic turbulence as the\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n56 Fabio Reale\\nphysical mechanism responsible for the transport of energy from the large scales, where energy is\\ninjected by photospheric motions, to the small scales, where it is dissipated (Rappazzo et al., 2007,\\n2008). Strong turbulence was found for weak axial magnetic fields and long loops. The predicted\\nheating rate is appropriate for warm loops, in agreement with Reale et al. (2005). Shell models of\\nrMHD turbulence were used to analyze the case of a coronal loop heated by photospheric turbulence\\nand found that the Alfve´n waves interact nonlinearly and form turbulent spectra (Buchlin and\\nVelli, 2007). An intermittent heating function is active, on average able to sustain the corona and\\nproportional to the aspect ratio of the loop to the ∼ 1.5 power. Adding a profile of density and/or\\nmagnetic field along the loop somewhat change the heat deposition, in particular in the low part of\\nthe loop (Buchlin et al., 2007). These models also predict the formation of current sheets that can\\nbe dissipated on these small scales and impulsively through turbulent cascades (Rappazzo et al.,\\n2010; Rappazzo and Velli, 2011). Transient current sheets are also found from large-scale full MHD\\nmodeling (Bingert and Peter, 2011). In the same framework loops have been described as partially\\nresonant cavities for low-frequency fluctuations transmitted from the chromosphere (Verdini et al.,\\n2012).\\nThere are new efforts to include magnetic effects in the loop modeling. Haynes et al. (2008)\\nstudied observational properties of a kink unstable coronal loop, using a fluid code and finding\\npotentially observable density effects. Browning et al. (2008) studied coronal heating by nanoflares\\ntriggered by a kink instability using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical simula-\\ntions of energy release for a cylindrical coronal loop model. Magnetic energy is dissipated, leading\\nto large or small heating events according to the initial current profile.\\nInteresting perspectives are developing from models in which self-organized criticality triggers\\nloop coronal heating (e.g., Lo´pez Fuentes and Klimchuk, 2010). For Uzdensky (2007) and Cassak\\net al. (2008) coronal heating is self-regulating and keeps the coronal plasma roughly marginally\\ncollisionless. In the long run, the coronal heating process may be represented by repeating cycles\\nthat consist of fast reconnection events (i.e., nanoflares), followed by rapid evaporation episodes,\\nfollowed by relatively long periods (∼ 1 hr) during which magnetic stresses build up and the\\nplasma simultaneously cools down and precipitates. An avalanche model was proposed for solar\\nflares (Morales and Charbonneau, 2008), based on an idealized representation of a coronal loop\\nas a bundle of magnetic flux strands wrapping around one another. The system is driven by\\nrandom deformation of the strands, and a form of reconnection is assumed to take place when the\\nangle subtended by two strands crossing at the same lattice site exceeds some preset threshold.\\nFor a generic coronal loop of length 1010 cm and diameter 108 cm, the mechanism leads to flare\\nenergies ranging between 1023 and 1029 erg, for an instability threshold angle of 11 degrees between\\ncontiguous magnetic flux strands.\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 57\\n5 Stellar Coronal Loops\\nNon-solar X-ray missions since Einstein and European X-ray Observatory SATellite (EXOSAT)\\nhave established that most other stars have a confined corona, often much more active that the\\nsolar one (e.g., Linsky and Serio, 1993). The level of activity is ruled by several factors, but, first\\nof all, the age of the star is important: young fast-rotating stars are more active (e.g., Telleschi\\net al., 2005). The topic of stellar coronal loops deserves a review by itself (e.g., Rosner et al., 1985)\\nand here only a few relevant issues are discussed. A complete and more recent review of stellar\\ncoronae, with an extensive part regarding loops, is by Gu¨del (2004). In the framework of the\\nsolar-stellar connection, it is very important the comparison of what we know about the spatially\\nresolved but single solar corona and what about the unresolved but numerous stellar coronae, which\\noffer a variety of different environments. The lack of spatial resolution inhibits to obtain direct\\ninformation about the size and appearance of the loops, and the general aspect of the corona. We\\ntherefore have to rely on indirect evidence. One possible approach to get information is to benefit\\nfrom transient X-ray events, such as flares, which provide estimations of the loop scale length\\nfrom their dependence on the decay and rise timescales (Reale, 2002a, 2003, and Section 4.1.2 for\\nreviews). Detailed hydrodynamic modeling can provide even more constraints, for instance, on\\nthe heat deposition (e.g., Reale et al., 1988, 2004). The study of stellar X-ray flares allowed, for\\ninstance, to constrain that most stellar flares involve plasma confined in closed structures (Reale\\net al., 2002), and to infer the presence both of loops with size similar to those observed on the Sun\\n(e.g., Reale et al., 1988) and of giant loops (Favata et al., 2005; Getman et al., 2008), with length\\nexceeding the stellar radius. Analogies between solar and stellar downflows have also been found\\n(Reale et al., 2013). Radio observations have provided direct evidence for the presence of large\\ncoronal loops in the Algol system (Peterson et al., 2010).\\nAnother approach is to use the entire solar X-ray corona as a template and “Rosetta stone”\\nto interpret stellar coronae. A detailed implementation of this approach was devised and applied\\nextensively using Yohkoh data over its entire life, which covers a whole solar cycle (Orlando et al.,\\n2000; Peres et al., 2000). It was shown that the solar corona indeed provides a pattern of com-\\nponents, i.e., quiet structures, active regions, active region cores, flares, which can be identified in\\nstellar coronal data and which can explain stellar activity giving different weights to the compo-\\nnents (Peres et al., 2001, 2004). The method was also applied to describe stellar coronae in terms\\nof loop populations and to extract general information and constraints on coronal heating (Peres\\net al., 2004). It was applied to flares (Reale et al., 2001) and to describe the evolution of active\\nregions (Orlando et al., 2004). More recently it was shown that a continuous unresolved flaring\\nactivity may explain the most active coronae, but also that the coronal heating appears to follow\\ndifferent scaling for quiet regions and for active and flaring regions across the cycle (Argiroffi et al.,\\n2008).\\nCargill and Klimchuk (2006) realized that the strong hot peaks in the emission measure-\\ntemperature distributions in the coronae of some binary stars (Sanz-Forcada et al., 2003) are\\nsimilar to those expected for an impulsively-heated solar corona. A coronal model comprised of\\nmany impulsively heated strands shows that the evidence may be compatible with coronae made\\nof many very small loops (length under 103 km) heated by microflares.\\nThe growing evidence of hot plasma and of variability will link more tightly the investigation\\nof the solar coronal heating to the study of stellar coronae, where very hot steady components are\\noften detected (e.g., Schmitt et al., 1990; Scelsi et al., 2005).\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n58 Fabio Reale\\n6 Conclusions and Perspectives\\nCoronal loops have been the subject of in-depth studies for over 50 years. Since they owe their\\nidentity to the brightness of the confined plasma, most of the studies have addressed the physics\\nof the confined plasma, i.e., its structure, dynamics, and evolution. The coronal loops are the\\nbuilding blocks of the bright solar corona and, as such, they are important as the basic laboratory\\nto investigate the mechanisms of coronal magnetism, dynamics, and heating. Our knowledge on\\ncoronal loops has progressed with the development of the instrument capabilities. The starting\\npoint has been the observation, mostly in the X-ray band, that coronal loops are globally steady on\\ntimescales longer than the plasma cooling times. This has allowed to develop the loop scaling laws,\\nwhich work well to describe the hydrostatic properties of coronal plasma confined in a magnetic\\nflux tube (Section 4.1.1). However, since the 1990s observations have more and more revealed\\nthat coronal loops are dynamic and structured, both spatially and thermally. Imaging instruments\\nhave shown bundles of fine strands whose thickness is not well resolved up-to-date, although we\\nbegin to have constraints from the latest observations with the Hi-C (∼ 100 km). The lack of\\nagreement about the thickness values might indicate a distribution of strand sizes (Section 3.2.2).\\nEUV spectroscopy shows a variety of thermal structuring, from nearly isothermal loops to broad\\ndistributions over a temperature decade (6 < log 𝑇 < 7). The width of the distributions might\\ndepend on the heating intensity (warm vs hot loops), on the age of the active region and/or on\\nthe magnetic field (Section 3.3). The presence, whenever confirmed, of minor but widespread and\\nfilamented, very hot plasma components (log 𝑇 ∼ 7) out of flares might be a tracer of small-\\nscale impulsive heating. Coronal rain might mark thermal instability on small scales of thickness.\\nHigh-resolution spectroscopy has also detected widespread flows (∼ 10 km s–1) with a complex\\npattern, especially low in the corona and transition region (Section 3.5). The pattern is described\\nquite well as switching from redshifts to blueshifts with increasing temperature, thus indicating\\nthe coexistence of cool downfalling plasma and warm evaporation. This complex pattern is also a\\nsignature of fine structure, at least in the low corona. Higher in the corona, flow patterns are less\\ndefined, simply because of geometrical reasons. Fast upflows (∼ 100 km s–1) from the chromosphere\\nmight play a role in feeding coronal loops (Section 3.5.1). Continuous monitoring of the full solar\\ndisk has also allowed very detailed photometric analysis (Section 3.4). The detailed analysis of\\nthe light curves seems to indicate the presence of systematic cooling patterns, both in the X-rays\\nand, from comparison of different channels, in the EUV band. The monitoring has also allowed\\nthe detection of MHD waves propagating along coronal loops (Section 3.5.2).\\nThe physics of the plasma confined inside coronal loops is well described with compressible\\nhydrodynamics with a very important role of thermal conduction and radiative losses from optically\\nthin medium. The mass and energy are transported mostly along the field lines, with little direct\\nrole of the magnetic field. The initial hydrostatic single loop scenario is now replaced by a much\\nmore dynamic one with loops structured into bundle of finer strands (Section 4.1.2). The physics\\nof the plasma inside each strand does not change much, but one important issue becomes how\\nthese strands combine into the unresolved observed structures. Multi-strand loop modeling is able\\nto explain the fuzzier and fuzzier appearance of loops observed in channels sensitive to hotter\\nand hotter emission, and flat filter ratios along loops (Section 4.2). A proper MHD description is\\nrequired when we need to address directly the interaction of plasma with the ambient magnetic\\nfield, both regarding the confinement itself, e.g., the expansion across the transition region, and\\nthe conversion of the magnetic energy to power the plasma temperature and dynamics. Although\\nflows along loops have long been modeled (Section 4.3), the recent evidence for upflows from the\\nchromosphere has provided a new boost to models and, since it has been suggested that the flows\\nmight also carry the energy to heat the loop plasma, it has also revitalized the investigation of\\ncoronal heating, the central issue of coronal loop physics. The most basic question regarding the\\nconversion of magnetic energy into heat remains probably whether this conversion occurs on small\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\nCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma 59\\nor large timescales, both in the charging and in the release (Section 4.4). This may make the\\ndifference between energy provided directly through fast magnetic reconnection (nanoflares) and\\nenergy dissipated more gradually by MHD waves, but new modeling seems to make the boundary\\nmuch more blurred, wheareas MHD waves are dissipated impulsively through turbulent cascades.\\nSo, at the moment, there is some convergence to heating mechanisms released on short timescales\\ninside thin strands composing the loops. The charge-and-release processes are also deserving\\nattention regarding both the connection to the magnetic field, and the cadence and distribution\\nof the events in the single strand. Turbulent cascades might provide a natural explanation for the\\ndissipation of magnetic energy in anomalously small scales.\\nKey issues for the future remain the loop fine structure and dynamics. We need to address\\nwhat are the ultimate elementary loop components, and whether they are unique or determined\\nby local conditions, i.e., what determines the section scale size. We need the highest possible\\nspatial resolution, probably in different bands. Further investigation of the plasma fine thermal\\nstructure and dynamics requires also high spectral resolution. High resolution broad-band X-ray\\nspectroscopy is foreseeable to probe the hot components, signature of impulsive heating. Also the\\ninvestigation of temporal variations still deserves attention. If loops are really so dynamic and sub-\\nject to a distribution of heating events, whatever it is, the light curves are very difficult to interpret\\nand signatures of any possible small-scale events are confused in a storming activity and by the\\nplasma inertia. The analysis of emission variations is very important, because it can potentially\\nshed light on heating mechanisms based on short impulsive events (nanoflares) or on wave-like\\nphenomena (Alfve´n waves). The continuous monitoring by the SDO mission is a very powerful\\ntool for temporal variability studies. The analysis of imaging multi-channel observations seems to\\nindicate widespread plasma cooling, which needs further independent investigation. Observations\\nfrom IRIS are providing very detailed information about the interaction of the corona with the\\nchromosphere and, in particular, about the intriguing transition region. Highest-resolution obser-\\nvations in the EUV seem also to emphasize the importance of the transition region, because it is\\nvery sensitive to changes of the physical conditions and, therefore, it can be a tracer of basic loop\\nprocesses.\\nGreat help is expected from modeling. Multi-stranded time-dependent loop models are still\\nproviding a wealth of information and might contribute to study specific issues such as the sequence\\nand the relative weight of evaporation-draining cycles, and the vertical structure and dynamics of\\nthe thin transition region. The coupling with the chromosphere is becoming increasingly important.\\nImproving numerical and computing resources are allowing to address the more basic question of\\nthe coupling of the plasma with the magnetic field and of the conversion of the magnetic energy\\ninto heat. The approaches involve both full MHD models and other models that couple different\\nregimes, such as the large-scale magnetic field and the locally confined plasma. A totally self-\\nconsistent description is still out-of-reach, but 3D MHD models are beginning to attack some very\\nbasic issues, regarding the heat release, such as the role of the MHD instabilities and their switch-\\non. Turbulence seems a key to the anomalous dissipation needed to explain the loop ignition.\\nThe study of coronal loops is very alive and is the subject of Coronal Loop Workshops, taking\\nplace every two years, which are site of debate, inspiration of new investigations, and school for\\nyoung investigators.\\nLiving Reviews in Solar Physics\\nhttp://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4\\n60 Fabio Reale\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe author thanks P.

       " 'abstract': 'Pronounced hygric seasonality determines the regional climate and, thus, the characteristics of rained agriculture in the Peruvian Callejón de Huaylas (Cordillera Blanca). Peasants in the Cuenca Auqui on the eastern slopes above the city of Huaraz attribute recently experienced challenges in agricultural production mainly to perceived changes in precipitation patterns. Statistical analyses of daily precipitation records at nearby Recuay (1964 to 2013) and Huaraz (1996 to 2013) stations do not corroborate the perceived changes. Either insufficient temporal resolution of available precipitation records or other environmental and sociopolitical factors impacting traditional farming methods may be the reason for the lack of concordance between the two information sources investigated in this study',\n",
